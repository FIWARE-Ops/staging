Each marker can be activated via an eye gaze trigger.1. - </p></li> </ul> <p>Interactive VR streaming is a novel technology with massive potential, enabling new possibilities for audiences who are not able to be at a location physically. AZ technology enables twofold unique benefits:</p> <p><strong>Production</strong> Event broadcasters can stream with multiple AZ cameras simultaneously. Our self-aware VR cameras are key to enabling a maximum level of automation, and hence facilitate easy adoption through first moving TV studios, event broadcasters, and video producers.</p> <p><strong>Consumption</strong> Audiences can revisit respective events in real-time, and jump between each of AZ’s camera’s locations at will. The cloud architecture furthermore creates a P2P ecosystem to host and distribute content directly to the end-user seamlessly. Consumers can view AR- enabled VR streams from any device, without the need for installation of additional software.</p>","challenge":"<p>On the huge field, one camera, even a 360° one is usually not enough. It is quite problematic both to switch between multiple streaming windows (especially with the hmd on) and to upload multiple streams with different metadata.</p> <p>VR is a young medium and requires a significant infrastructure push to become adopted to the mainstream. A lack of infrastructure is found on both ends of the value chain of digital media creation: <strong>1.Production</strong> Interactivity in a 360° video can only be achieved if the video is embedded on a website, which creates additional costs for web development. An average video production company with two clients per month will spend an estimate of:</p> <ul> <li><p>5,350€ for PC and 360° camera; </p></li> <li><p>2,600€ per year for software licenses and freelance web developers; </p></li> <li><p>20 hours of work per project.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Consumption</strong></p> <p>The access to interactive content and the device used for consumption is  as important as the content creation itself. The US alone counts 2,2 mio. people in a wheelchair who are significantly limited in participating in socio-cultural events like festivals or football matches.

It is a free-floating wireless sensor ‘Freeparticle’ for online measurement in production scale bioreactors. Understanding the mixing conditions within industrial-scale bioreactors has been a topic of huge importance both for academics and process engineers for many years, as understanding this properly can lead to significant process improvements in the production process. Unfortunately, until now there has been no way of getting an accurate and validated understanding of what is happening inside these reactors during operation. The Freeparticle is the first device globally that can measure inhomogeneity inside bioreactors using its unique patent-pending positioning algorithm. This disruptive technology has already been embraced by multiple multinational bio players in Europe and abroad.</p> <p>In addition to measuring inhomogeneity, the Freeparticle can measure other critical liquid analytical parameters such as pH, temperature, pressure, and in the future also glucose inside within the bioreactor. The novel data from the sensors gives scientists for the first time, a true picture of what is happening at all points within their bioreactors during a fermentation. This, combined with predictive data analysis will bring extremely valuable insights to the industry.</p> <p>The particles can be added to the bioreactor before production, allowing the user to autoclave the sensors before use. Once the production process begins, the sensors activate and start sending out wireless data from within the tank, directly into the users’ production system and the Freesense cloud-based software. From the data analysis software, the user can see the measurements in real- time from the tank, enabling them to adjust certain production parameters such as heat transfer and stirring speeds and adapt the bioreactor construction to eliminate the gradients and reach higher output yields and optimize their processes accordingly. The Freeparticle is a game changer for the bioproduction industry, bringing industry 4.0 and artificial intelligence to their liquid fermentation processes.</p>","challenge":"<p>Today in the bio-industry, a detailed picture of what really  happens inside large bioreactors during fermentation remains largely unknown. It is also widely known and accepted in both academia and industry that significant gradients exist within these large tanks due to inefficient stirring and process control during operation.</p> <p>Traditionally, process chemists rely on the analysis of off-line samples (e.g. cell dry weight) combined with a few on-line measurements at single points in the bioreactor (e.g. pH and temperature) to make decisions on how to adjust the operation.</p> <p>The References/Customers’ concern is that the traditional measurements do not give enough information to make any significant improvements in the processes.

We compile four orthogonal layers: the terrain + crops + pesticides + the available machinery into an optimized mission planning, auto-execution, and real-time control of each robot. Each robot can have different performance and accuracy levels and therefore the optimized solution fits for small, medium, or large farmlands. SKYX solution is for spraying applicators, and not for growers.</p> <p>We develop two main products:</p> <ul> <li><p>Uniform Coverage (UC): The area treated is sprayed homogeneously. </p></li> <li><p>Spots Coverage (SC): The area is scanned from air (UV+IR+Image recognition) to detect affected areas (spots).

Typical equipment in the truck includes the robots (drones), the required pesticides that the growers (their References/Customers) selected and purchased, a few batteries, and spare parts. </p> <p>Before  driving to the farmland, SKYX mission planning already calculated the optimized starting location and the exact path and number of hops that each robot will perform, so the spraying provider already knows what exactly will be done by each robot (and he can also simulate more robots, agriculture constraints, etc.). Static obstacles and details about the farmland were already loaded in the software. Upon arrival to the farmland, a quick single-drone flight detects unexpected obstacles, and if needed an updated path is calculated by the software in milliseconds. The spraying provider assembles the swarm, (each robot is loaded with pesticides, batteries, propellers, cameras, and sensors) and according to the mission planning “go” button is pushed and activates the autonomous spraying swarm. </p> <p>There is no need to fly/drive/control the entire operation. While the swarm is spraying, the operator monitors the progress and can decide to “abort” the mission. The swarm corrects in real-time glitches and can recalculate new segments (alerts are given to the operator). The only manual work the operator is doing is recharging batteries and tanks of pesticides between the multiple hops. At the end of the mission, detailed reporting is given for grower/customer pricing, maintenance of the fleet, and regulatory reporting.</p>","challenge":"<p>Due to the expected population growth from 7 billion to 9 billion by 2050, the EU's Common Agricultural Policy noted that world food production needs to double by then and at the same time needs to institute 'greener' farming practices. Given there is not likely to be additional land available to meet these needs, higher yield influenced by precision agriculture will be essential. Drones, as part of overall autonomous robotics, are called to provide revolutionary forms of farming.</p> <p>Spraying agricultural crops with pesticides and other materials is a common practice in order to protect the crops from harmful pests and diseases. 99% of global farmlands still use intensive human-driven spraying of chemicals: by flying airplanes, driving tractors, or manually with backpacks. Current practices lead to inefficiencies as Very high costs of operation, hand-workers present availability problems, and spraying aircraft can mostly be flown during the day and in good weather (for pilots' safety). Airplanes do not fly with obstacles or need to be high above the ground to avoid possible obstacles, thus the spraying accuracy cannot be guaranteed, leading to inadequate coverage (poor crop protection). </p> <p>In addition, tractors are expensive to transport, working with pesticides is hazardous for people and the environment. The opportunity lies in  developing technologies that allow  increasing production, sustainability and safety, reducing costs and ensuring total and absolute crop protection to/against infections and diseases.</p> <p>Drones have demonstrated to be a reliable solution for spraying fields and several brands manufacture and commercialize them. But it takes too long to spray a single field with just one drone. What none of these brands provide is the ability to autonomously control several drones at the same time, all of them cooperating in the spray mission.</p>","references":"","awards":"","technologies":["Internet of Things","Logistsics","Micro/Nano Electronics"],"domains":["AgriFood"],"docs":[],"videos":[["Detect and Avoid-YouTube","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFLwfrhEQqQ"],["Spraying Drones","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61W_UHvEl-0"]],"materials":[["Start Up Nation  Central","http://blog.startupnationcentral.org/agritech/skyx-agriculture-swarm-drones"],["Disruptor Daily","https://www.disruptordaily.com/skyx-solving-agriculture-spraying-24-7-available-highly-accurate/"],["Crunchbase","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lahakx"]],"additionalText":"","logo":"logo_LahakX.svg","featuredImage":"hero_LahakX_Skyx_Pass.png","furtherImages":"","hash":"lahakx-skyxpass","member":false,"cat":"powered","social":"/powered-by-fiware/lahakx/skyx-pass.html","img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/logo/logo_LahakX.svg","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/hero/hero_LahakX_Skyx_Pass.png"},"limmatgroup-imas":{"category":"Powered by FIWARE","organisationName":"Limmat Group","productName":"IMAS+","organisationWebsite":"https://limmat-group.com/en_us/","organisationEmail":"mailto:info@limmat-group.com","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/limmat-group/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Limmat_Group","productWebsite":"https://limmat-group.com/en_us/soluciones/#id_imas","excerpt":"IMAS+® is Smart Maintenance Platform for Infrastructure.

Since August 2016, it has acquired more than 80,000 users.</p> <p>Currently, the company has two products that correspond to two business lines. The first is AITA, focused on offering all Travel services to the end-user. The second is the white label Chatbot SaaS (Software as a Service), focused on Travel Service Suppliers, so that they can boost their direct sales channels through the CHAT.</p> <p>The Travel chatbot, AITA, has been developed with the following fundamental values:</p> <ul> <li>Transactional and assistance: 100% automated, it doesn’t require any human assistance. This is a particularly important milestone to allow its scalability. </li> <li>Omnichannel: Currently works in Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, SMS, App, and Web. nixi1’s team has developed a deep know-how to integrate any new messaging quickly. In addition, it can be integrated into mail and in the future, it will do the same in Voice Assistants such as Siri, Alexa, or Google when their respective marketplaces are enabled. </li> <li>Multi-language: Currently the chatbot is available natively in English, Spanish, French, and German and available in 95 other languages ​​through automatic translation protocols (non-native). The linguistic corpus architecture based on a contextualized sales funnel and several layers of neural networks allow the easy native translation of the chatbot into different languages.</li> <li>Voice notes: We have added the functionality of voice notes to the text and we have provided the forms with predictive capabilities.</li> </ul> <p>Currently, nixi1 is integrated with a broad universe of travel suppliers that gives access to a massive range of tourism services at the best price. 92% of our users say they have found the cheapest option with our solution.</p> <p>The solution for B2B helps to avoid intermediates by promoting a new direct sales channel, which also helps to acquire users at a low price, improve loyalty rates and reduce operational costs thanks to the AI. For the final consumer, it is a more economical and convenient solution.</p>","challenge":"<p>nixi1 has two customer segments. On one hand, the main problems for Travel Service Suppliers (B2B) like hotels and airlines are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>DISINTERMEDIATION</strong>. There’s an excessive dependence on indirect sales channels such as OTAs (Online Travel Agencies), which charge high commissions, 15-35%. </li> <li><strong>OPERATIONAL COSTS</strong>. Expensive and numerous call-centers. It is estimated that between 10% and 15% of all reservations of Travel Service Suppliers is via phone call and 100% of the services of customer services are operated by humans, with a high operational cost. It is a constant priority to search for mechanisms to reduce these costs. </li> <li><strong>LOYALTY</strong>. Most travelers are price-oriented, which generates a dependence on OTAs, a channel in which the user can compare the wide range of services. The only two channels of direct communication (email and phone calls) handled by Travel Service Suppliers, beyond the web and the App, have a very low acceptance rate. </li> <li><strong>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS (CAC)</strong>. CACs are very high due to the duopoly of Booking Holdings and Expedia in Google SEM. Besides, it’s an oligopolistic sector, a few GDSs, Consolidators, TA (Travel Agencies), OTA, and Metasearchers have more than 80% share in their respective categories).</li> </ul> <p>On the other hand, if we consider the traveler (B2C), the two biggest challenges in the industry are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>PRICE</strong>. In general terms, the traveler is sensitive to the price, the cheaper the better, as long as a quality threshold is maintained. This is even more relevant in the FLIGHT reservation, which is the first purchase of a trip. In addition, the user wants to know the final price from the beginning and not be tricked by unexpected charges at the end of the process. </li> <li><strong>CONVENIENCE</strong>. The more comfortable the solution, the better. The traveler aims to access the biggest and most competitive offer in the market on  a single site, without unwanted redirects and without having to consult several websites or apps.</li> </ul>","references":"","awards":"","technologies":["Data Analytics","Open Data"],"domains":["Cities"],"docs":[],"videos":[["Demo Chatnfly WhatsApp-YouTube","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD9ZsmNu48M"],["Demo Chatnfly Hotels WhatsApp-YouTube","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8JYMHV7a4I"]],"materials":[],"additionalText":"","logo":"logo_nixi1.svg","featuredImage":"hero_nixi1_nixi1.png","furtherImages":"","hash":"nixi1-nixi1","member":false,"cat":"powered","social":"/powered-by-fiware/nixi1/nixi1.html","img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/logo/logo_nixi1.svg","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/hero/hero_nixi1_nixi1.png"},"openmove-openmove":{"category":"Powered by FIWARE","organisationName":"OpenMove","productName":"OpenMove","organisationWebsite":"","organisationEmail":"","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/openmove/?originalSubdomain=it","twitter":"https://twitter.com/openmove?lang=en","productWebsite":"https://openmove.com","excerpt":"OpenMove is a software platform for smart mobility that features transport ticketing, on-demand transport in real-time, intermodal journey planning and MaaS (Mobility-as-a-Service) integration.\n\nThe company is active in EU + USA + Middle East and serves 10M+ yearly passengers / 50M€+ tickets sold.","yearOfValidation":2014,"description":"<p><strong>OpenMove</strong> is an end-to-end mobility platform with 24/7 cloud provision which features multiple ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) modules.</p> <ul> <li>AFC (Automated Fare Collection) system which allows sales capabilities across multiple channels as well as a comprehensive set of tools for the personnel of the transport service provider.</li> <li>Account-Based Ticketing</li> <li>Omnichannel digital sales (e-commerce, white-label app, sales tools for field personnel and ticket shops, on-board validators and gates)</li> <li>Fast and reliable activation of tickets</li> <li>Anti-fraud detection</li> <li>DRT (Demand-Responsive Transit).

In other words, MUV is a holistic App since it not only delivers information on demand but also provides a more comprehensive platform throughout all the aspects of urban mobility. From this configuration, the MUV architecture is divided into two main sectors: one for the final user and the other one for all the officers in charge of the mobility management. For each of these two broad sectors, there are different modules. </p> <p>The modules aimed at serving the mobility users are called: </p> <ul> <li>City-Glance</li> <li>City-Loop</li> <li>City-Zen </li> <li>City-Green</li> </ul> <p>City-Glance's main aim is to reduce both mobility actors’ and services' fragmentation. While, on the one hand, users need  reliable and effective support to make their mobility choice, on the other hand, this same situation hinders public administrators to obtain a comprehensive overview of their local mobility market. In other words, while users need  reliable and effective support to make their mobility choices, local authorities and mobility agencies (our References/Customers) need an efficient support system able to describe what really happens between the mobility offer and demand.  Thus, the main goal of the City-Glance module is, on the one hand, to create a reliable single point of access for the users, and, on the other hand, to provide Municipalities with a clear overview of all the aspects occurring in the city. </p> <p>The <strong>second module</strong>, City-Loop module’s main focus is to enrich the experience of every mobility user (commuter, usual traveler, family cruiser, etc). Once the user is registered to the platform, MUV starts acting as a sort of concierge mode service provider.  This module treats all mobility users as  true References/Customers. In fact, if Cities want to achieve  real smart mobility, then focusing on users is of fundamental importance. In other words, the assumption at the basis of the City-Loop module is that every mobility user should be treated like a real customer of the whole urban market, and the satisfaction of those References/Customers should be the central aim of the Public Administrators in charge of the mobility management.</p> <p>The <strong>third module</strong>, the City-Zen module is composed of features aimed at engaging and empowering users’ mobility in the urban area. Thanks to the City-Zen module every registered user can send feedback about the status of the mobility (traffic jam, busy bus, etc.). Every feedback sent by the users is georeferenced and shared with other users and the Municipality. Users can comment on the feedback sent by others and give a plus or minus through the \"karma\" system. The feedback and the Karma system are linked to a rewarding system. This latter creates seniority levels and rewards based on the users’ activities (more feedback, more plusses received, higher obtained reward). </p> <p>The <strong>last developed module</strong> for the mobility users is called the City-Green and it is designed to support municipalities in delivering active policies to the modal shifting (from private cars to the low emission means of transportation). This module allows the user to create a specific profile with specific trips (e.g.: favorite destinations). Each time a user states that the trip she/he is making is green, then she/he must click on the tracking button that registers the trip’s data. An algorithm validates all the registered data and assigns a green score to the user which is later on stored in the user’s green profile. This feature can be linked to external systems of social and environmental reward such as GreenApes.  As mentioned above, mobility managers and officers can rely on three MUV’s modules: the first one is called ‘Planning tool' and is aimed at designing and planning the services and facilities of urban mobility. The second module is composed of all the management services that are used to manage the mobility services delivered to the users. The last module encompasses MUV’s Analytics, these features are intended to serve multiple analysis and report on all the aspects referred to the urban mobility dynamics.</p>","challenge":"<p>MUV-App is a platform designed to turn the mobility system into a safe, sustainable and user-friendly system. Urban mobility is, in fact, often perceived as a messy and complex world to deal with. However, we believe that there are a lot of chances to improve the performance of the system. The ever-evolving world of mobility is enriching the offer (especially in terms of Mobility as a Service - MaaS - system), but, in parallel, the complexity of the system is growing.  The plurality of actors and services available leads to an atomization of the users' experience and  fragmentation of sources and data. MUV's core idea is based on the concept of MaaS for  public administration. Thanks to the application of the MaaS' governance system, MUV provides innovative tools for the management of the entire mobility system. Looking for a clear and easy city mobility view, we developed the MUV App identifying four main areas of intervention:</p> <ol> <li>Fragmentation and complexity derived from multiple subjects and different services (fragmented data  Poor quality of user experience throughout the services delivered; </li> <li>Lack of attention for the users in terms of engagement and empowering; </li> <li>Need for effective tools to support green mobility policies.</li> </ol>","references":"","awards":"","technologies":["Mobility and Location","Open Data","Software as a Service"],"domains":["Air Quality","Automotive","Logistics","Mobility","Transport"],"docs":[["City Glance","https://muv-app.city/city-glance"],["City Loop","https://muv-app.city/city-loop"],["City Zen","https://muv-app.city/city-zen"]],"videos":[["MUV_App on Vimeo","https://vimeo.com/283417605"]],"materials":[["SoundCloud","https://soundcloud.com/h3b-media/frontiercities2-filippo-severi-muv"]],"additionalText":"","logo":"logo_Phoops.svg","featuredImage":"hero_phoops_MUV-App.png","furtherImages":"","hash":"phoops-muvapp","member":true,"cat":"powered","social":"/powered-by-fiware/phoops/muv-app.html","img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/logo/logo_Phoops.svg","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/hero/hero_phoops_MUV-App.png"},"profirator-lakesprofispace":{"category":"Powered by FIWARE","organisationName":"Profirator","productName":"lakes.profi.space","organisationWebsite":"https://profirator.fi/","organisationEmail":"mailto:info@profirator.fi","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/profirator-ltd/about/","twitter":"","productWebsite":"https://profirator.fi/product-and-pricing/","excerpt":"Lakes is the Smart City IoT platform you can get started in minutes.

The key innovation is to generate the content directly from the manufacturing PLM system of the enterprise. Over the last decade, many companies have invested in digitization initiatives including representing the manufacturing and service processes in the digital domain using solutions such as Siemens Teamcenter, Dassault 3DExperience, and PTC Windchill.</p> <p>The VISTRA solution offers the capability to import data from these systems to an automation engine thatis capable to build ready-for-use simulation components of these manufacturing and service processes which can be served up to a range of applications and interfaces which present the simulation to consumers according to their specific use case. In the described architecture this simulation data derived from the PLM system is called the ‘Enhanced Digital Twin’ (EDT) and includes data such as geometry assemblies, technical procedures and enhancements such as automatically-generated animations, critical knowledge components, and more. The EDT is stored in the VISTRA backed application VISTRA Management System (VMS) and is made available to client applications as a ‘simulation flow’ of 3d components.</p> <p>Following this automation approach solves the major barriers described in the previous section:</p> <ul> <li>Cost of content production: creating and deploying simulation content requires no particular technical skillset, and relies on CPU/GPU-time rather than human hours, speeding up the production time by several orders of magnitude. </li> <li>Easy content maintenance: as the manufacturing engineering and service specialists revise processes the updated simulation can be generated in just minutes. Furthermore, there is no vendor reliance to manage the updating process and deliver the results in a timely fashion. </li> <li>Data security: as a tool used inside the enterprise the most sensitive data never needs to leave the organizations’ corporate network.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, the data can be used to support multiple use cases, creating a significant multiplier effect.</p>","challenge":"<p>Manufacturing companies have long been aware of the potential for virtual training to contribute to operator training and technician support systems, but the expected impact has never been reached, primarily due to the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>Cost of content production: building the simulation training by a manual process is technically complex and time-consuming, hence the cost of bespoke solutions is high and in many cases cannot meet the required RoI. </li> <li>Impractical content maintenance: in many manufacturing companies the assembly process is constantly updated to achieve more efficient production, as often as multiple times in a single day during ramp-up phases. Changes to assembly processes also impact service and installation procedures, which are further complicated by being branched workflows with context-sensitive decision making.

Such complexity further increases the pressure to prepare the operators and technicians correctly as the number of operations expected to be performed by the operators increases dramatically, while in many cases they will only be performed infrequently, both of which contribute to many challenges in relation to quality.</p>","references":"","awards":"","technologies":["Internet of Things","Additive Manufacturing"],"domains":["Industry"],"docs":[],"videos":[],"materials":[],"additionalText":"","logo":"logo_Sentio.svg","featuredImage":"hero_Sentio_VISTRA.png","furtherImages":"","hash":"sentio-vistra","member":false,"cat":"powered","social":"/powered-by-fiware/sentio/vistra.html","img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/logo/logo_Sentio.svg","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/hero/hero_Sentio_VISTRA.png"},"sirusnv-siruscitystore":{"category":"Powered by FIWARE","organisationName":"Sirus NV","productName":"Sirus City Store","organisationWebsite":"https://sirus.be/","organisationEmail":"","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/sirus-nv/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Sirus_be","productWebsite":"https://sirus.be/smart-cities/","excerpt":"The Sirus Smart City store helps cities harmonize all the data gathered by different sensors and platforms in the city.

It includes a series of modules that allow the acquisition, processing, storage, and distribution of data, on which several City Services, vertical IoT solutions,and Data Analytics can be implemented easily. This platform is based on the standards, and interfaces developed within the framework of the European FIWARE initiative</p> <p>The functionality of  Telefonica’s Thinking Cities platform focuses on the lifecycle of the data related to the service and aspects related to the client’s part. In this sense, four main groups of the case of use can be distinguished: Data insertion in the platform: acquisition of data from sensors and external systems to be stored on the platform. Data transformation in the platform: operations carried out in the platform with the data available to generate new data. Query of data of the platform - Visualization and extraction of data stored on the platform, either by end-users or by other modules. Sending data from the platform - Sending notifications or commands as a consequence of data entry on the platform or administrative tasks.</p> <p>The main modules of this platform are:</p> <p>1) <strong>IoT Agents</strong>. This component collects all the observations that come from the devices and transforms them into NGSi events available in the Context Broker. In this way, applications can consume information from observations from the devices and send commands (in the case of devices that support this functionality).</p> <p>2) <strong>Context Broker</strong> (Orion) The Context Broker is a module that retrieves, maintains, and introduces context information within the platform. It is an implementation of the Generic Enabler Publish / Subscribe Context Broker defined in FIWARE, providing NGSI interfaces.</p> <p>3) <strong>NGSI Data Adapter</strong> (Cygnus) Cygnus is the component that is responsible for processing the data sent by the Context Broker in its notification format and adapting them to the different sinks of the platform, such as MySQL, CKAN, Hadoop, or Mongo.</p> <p>4) <strong>Open Data Portal</strong> (CKAN) CKAN is a tool for open data web portals. Facilitates the management and publication of data collections. It is widely used by national, regional and local governments, research centers and other organizations that accumulate large amounts of data.</p> <p>5) <strong>Short-term historic</strong> (STH) Allows the storage of data processed by the Context Broker and allows its subsequent recovery both in the form of raw data and aggregated data.</p> <p>6)<strong>Analytical database</strong>(ADB) Makes the data stored internally on the platform available to the presentation layer.</p> <p>7)<strong>Business Intelligence</strong> (BI) Main part of the presentation layer.</p> <p>8) <strong>Extract, Transform and Load information</strong> tools (ETL, ESB) Because there is data stored in external sources that have to be loaded in the platform, there are two modules in charge of obtaining information from these sources, transforming it into a format compatible with the platform and storing it in the different data sinks.</p> <p>9) <strong>Complex Event Processor</strong> (CEP) Analyzes data coming from events in real-time, infers insights immediately and makes possible an instantaneous response to changing conditions.</p> <p>10) <strong>Bid Data Analysis</strong> (Hadoop) Free code framework for the storage and large-scale processing of datasets in consumer hardware clusters.</p> <p>11) <strong>Identity Manager, Policy Enforcement, Policy Administration</strong> (IDM&amp;AUTH) Identity management, authentication and authorization scheme based on three main elements (IDM, PEP, and PAP/PDP).</p> <p>12) <strong>Administration portal</strong>. The administration portal provides a user interface to facilitate certain operations of the platform such as the creation of services, sub services, and users as well as the administration of entities, devices, subscriptions, and rules of each one of the services discharged.</p>","challenge":"<ul> <li>Smart Valencia VLCi -

You will learn how long this shelf-life exactly is – depending on the temperatures at which the product was stored and transported along the entire supply chain.","yearOfValidation":2018,"description":"<p>Most foods have a longer shelf-life than we think and with tsenso, you will learn how long this shelf life exactly is – depending on the temperatures at which the product was stored and transported along the entire supply chain. We call it the “<strong>Fresh Index</strong>”, the new real-time shelf-life indicator for food. With the tsenso cloud, all temperature data along the supply chain are linked centrally.  This creates a complete temperature history of the products – from the producer to the distribution and in long-term also to refrigerators at home. We develop the fresh index in collaboration with specialists: We have initiated cooperations with researching universities and experienced software experts. For field tests, we reach out to commerce and logistics businesses. With the help of the Fresh Index, you can always assess whether a food is safe and suitable for sale and consumption. In online grocery stores, it offers a quick overview of the freshness of perishable products.</p> <p>The Fresh Index is the new “expiry” date for food in place of the static best before date. It is not printed but can be read out via an app and displayed digitally, e.g. on digital price tags and in online grocery stores. This keeps it dynamic: As long as the product is temperature-monitored, the index is updated automatically. The fresh index indicates how fresh the product is. The higher the number, the fresher the food is, and the longer its shelf life is. The freshness data of the product is stored in the tsenso cloud and can be retrieved at any time. Along the food supply chain, this means that on arrival it can be checked immediately in what condition the goods are. For this application, we develop an app. Especially in online food stores,  proof of the quality of perishable products is important. The Fresh Index increases transparency and strengthens customer confidence.</p> <p>For retailers and their References/Customers, the Fresh Index offers the advantage of being able to read the actual shelf life of products. The “first expired, first-out” principle is optimized: what is going to expire first is sold first. Particularly fresh products can be promoted via the Fresh Index. And food which should be consumed soon can be easily identified and saved, e.g. with special offers.</p> <p>We all know this case: sometimes we find an old, expired product in the refrigerator and are not sure – can I still eat it? The answer is usually: yes. But often this is not visible and we rarely rely on our eyes and nose. Who wants to take a risk? In the long term, we at tsenso want to bring the Fresh Index to the refrigerators at home. By app or the smart fridge, the index will then show the true freshness and safety of food.</p> <p>The temperature has a significant impact on food safety and shelf life. The tsenso cloud solution reliably monitors the cold chain. Special feature: the solution can be integrated into existing processes without additional infrastructure. tsenso offers two options:</p> <p>1.) Complete solution: Temperature cloud as well as the tsenso Bluetooth sensors to read out temperature data within seconds.  2.) Cloud solution: Temperature cloud for a detailed evaluation of existing temperature data. Increase transparency and security while reducing food loss along your supply chain. We link the temperature data of the individual sections, such as production, logistics, storage, retail, and delivery service. This results in an individual temperature history for each product.</p> <p>Based on the complete temperature history and the characteristics of the individual product, we can calculate the food safety respectively the expected shelf life. This is used to check whether the safety has actually been influenced by temperature fluctuations and whether the food is still suitable for sale and consumption. For this complex analysis, we have initiated cooperations with several universities, researching food safety for years. The complex data from the simulation is combined and translated into a simple number: the Fresh Index. This index shows at a glance how fresh and safe a product is. It is calculated in real-time and updated as the temperature conditions change.</p>","challenge":"<p>Expiry dates as used in the food industry today are important achievements in providing food safety but are also subject to considerable criticism.

Targeting smart cities, municipalities can leverage the built-in smart lighting system to manage its infrastructure and program their operational mode, based on a set of pre-programmed options. LED technology allows for a running cost reduction, given its efficiency, but the software component brings this reduction to another level when it comes to maintenance and programmability.With its clean and minimalistic design, the optional Small Cell module can also be incorporated, giving municipalities the chance to monetize their original investment, by allowing Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to rent this infrastructure's networking capabilities.  As 5G technology is emerging, MNOs are investing largely in new infrastructure to meet their clients' demands. With the built-in Small Cell module and our set of NFV and SDN-based cloud services, MNOs can drastically reduce their initial investment, by renting already deployed and available infrastructure, effectively increasing their current capacity and coverage in a matter of minutes.

In BIM, the model encompasses the physical entity’s geometrical and temporal information, yet it requires manual data insertion for updates due to the lack of linkage between the model and the physical entity, whereas utilizing a digital twin can provide mutual interaction between the two counterparts in real time.  The use of sensors and the Internet of things (IoT) technologies easily allow a bidirectional transfer of information, updating the virtual model according to the physical counterpart’s live updates. Furthermore, due to the potential of performing simulations on the virtual model, future forecasting and optimization of the physical entity’s performances of the building are achievable, and thus the optimization of the physical counterpart’s performance can be reached.  In XDT the data collection over the edge is performed through a component of the Digital Enabler named IoT Device Manager that has allowed the plug-in of devices installed in the building, provided by different vendors (in the specific use case, vendors are Schneider and Bticino) and the compliance with the edge computing model: a lightweight module is deployed nearby the curtain wall sensors and collects the data from them. Such module supports a plethora of IoT-specific protocols, like Modbus, BacNet, MQTT, and many more. The IoT Device Manager embeds all the FIWARE IoT Agents. Once the data is collected from the edge, the data harmonization using a no-code (i.e. graphical) approach is performed. In particular, the Digital Enabler component that is in charge of the data processing and harmonization is the Data Mashup Editor. This accelerator allows representing in NGSI-LD format the data gathered and integrated, using Smart Data Models. Once the data is harmonized in data models, it is analyzed both on the edge and on the cloud.  The former feature is particularly relevant when a high-speed reaction is required; the latter is more relevant in case of historical analysis, training of AI models and in general, more resource-expensive activities. In fact, starting from environmental data gathered from the field (temperature, humidity, indoor pollution, irradiance), the solution is able to deduce information about indoor comfort and people productivity and show the data in the building Digital Twin, applying algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence.</p>","challenge":"<p>Recently, the evolution of 3D models has been gaining high research attention in several fields, such as aerospace and manufacturing, as well as Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC).

The Digital Twin in construction is expected to augment architectural modeling as a progressive step that develops from Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the AEC field. The use of Digital Twins would contribute to making buildings smarter and enhancing their sustainability. The smart building is depicted as utilizing cyber-physical intelligence to improve building functions, provide more comfortable and safe conditions for people and businesses, and increase overall satisfaction.

Xapix is significantly faster, more flexible, and more powerful than traditional approaches to data transformation, normalization, and integration, using the power of automation so that IT professionals can use data from hundreds of sources instead of only a few. The solution features a scalable micro service-driven architecture based on a library of data transformation adapters.</p> <p>Xapix was built to unlock the full value of the enterprise data and help businesses take advantage of new standards such as NGSI. Existing services and database/middleware infrastructure from the enterprise can be reused and leveraged through data transformation to open modern RESTful JSON APIs to users so that they can partner at scale.</p> <p>At the core of the Xapix offering is a data transformation tool that allows developers to define an automated transformation between existing data and a modeled output. The existing data sources can be RESTful APIs, SOAP XML services, EDI, or a direct connection to databases such as MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, and others. Adapters read in the services from the existing interfaces and allow developers to reconstruct the output such that a more developer-friendly output can be offered. Developers can choose to have the output delivered in various formats such as JSON, XML, CSV, and others. The new output is auto-generated and can then be adjusted by the user.</p> <p>As part of the data transformation process, the output data can be renamed, cached, filtered, chained,  combined with other APIs, and changed by input functions. This further improves the quality and performance of services offered to developers. Additionally, microservices can be leveraged for more complex operations. The data transformation tooling can be used as a cloud service or on-premises solution—depending on the needs and setup of your IT team.</p>","challenge":"<p>Whether you are working for a city, large industrial firm, or a growing player in your industry, FIWARE offers the potential to quickly connect to a set of applications in order to solve your own challenges or provide a solution serving a broader ecosystem. </p> <p>But how can you take advantage of FIWARE functionalities if the data model that FIWARE advocates isn’t compatible with your existing data setup? A number of challenges need to be addressed from the perspective of a CTO, IT architect, or developer: What’s the cost of being compliant with standards?

Furthermore, integrating smart parking technology with existing infrastructure and systems poses technical challenges that need to be addressed for seamless operation and effective utilization of data. Over the last five years, we have doubled down on efforts to bring artificial intelligence into the picture.  The aim is to use Deep Learning algorithms with processed images to discern between occupied/free car park slots with the absolute minimum number of sensors. The solution has been developed in conjunction with the R&amp;D technology Centre Tekniker.</p>","references":"<p>Since the year 2000, Dinycon has installed smart parking in more than 80 projects projects.

Our system relies on low-cost IP cameras and specially designed visual codes for multiple and moving readings. This patented technology allows for the optimization and error prevention of common logistics processes such as loading and unloading goods in logistic warehouses, order fulfillment, and inventory management. Our system replaces traditional identification systems (barcodes, DataMatrix, or RFID) by overcoming their technological deficiencies and offering new functionalities that traditional technologies cannot provide. Key technical features of our system include:</p> <ul> <li>Real-time position and movement vector acquisition of each code in the work environment. For instance, it can detect whether goods are being loaded onto or unloaded from a truck during a truck loading/unloading process, enabling thorough control and error prevention in logistics.</li> <li>Real-time multiple and moving readings of all codes. The system can read codes in motion without speed restrictions and all codes the goods might carry.</li> <li>Real-time height and volume calculation of goods. Using the code, it is possible, for example, to determine the height and volume of a pallet during an expedition process.</li> <li>Reading proof through photo or video. Each code read is recorded in the system with a photo or video of when the reading occurred. This allows for documentary evidence of the goods loaded during an expedition process.</li> <li>Codes can be printed on any type of media, such as typical labels, and can encode the SSCC identifier or any other required by the company.</li> <li>The system offers a well-defined API for integration into the company’s software.</li> <li>Additionally, it supports installations of more than 100 cameras simultaneously reading codes in real-time.</li> </ul>","challenge":"<p>The development of our solution based on Computer Vision and Bleecker codes represents a significant advancement over current identification and tracking technologies, such as RFID and barcodes, widely used in warehouse logistics.</p> <ul> <li><p>RFID Technology: While RFID systems offer robust tracking capabilities without the need for line of sight, they have limitations in terms of resolution and accuracy in environments densely populated with metallic or liquid goods, where interference is common. Additionally, the implementation costs of RFID can be high due to the need for specific tags and readers. Our solution, by utilizing Computer Vision, overcomes these limitations by providing precise identification without material interference and potentially lower operational costs, as Bleecker codes can be printed directly on existing product labels without the need for additional complex technology.</p></li> <li><p>Barcodes: Barcodes are a proven and cost-effective solution for product identification but require the reader to have a clear line of sight and no movement towards the label, which can be challenging in dynamic and fast-paced logistics environments. In contrast, Computer Vision with Bleecker codes allows for continuous recognition and tracking of multiple moving codes, with enhanced capabilities to operate in less-than-ideal conditions and process information more flexibly and robustly.</p></li> </ul> <p>Numerous advantages of our solution can be highlighted, but the most significant are:</p> <ul> <li>Enhanced tracking capability: Computer Vision allows for continuous, real-time tracking of pallets and goods, surpassing the deficiencies of RFID and barcodes.</li> <li>Operational flexibility: Our technology offers greater flexibility in changing and dynamic environments. It can quickly adapt to new warehouse layouts or process changes without the need for intensive reconfiguration.</li> <li>Advanced applications: Our solution introduces functionalities unfeasible with RFID and barcodes, such as calculating the dimensions of goods and precise identification of merchandise.</li> <li>Cost reduction: By reducing reliance on specific and expensive hardware like RFID systems and minimizing reading and tracking errors, our solution can offer significant reductions in operational and maintenance costs.</li> </ul>","references":"<p>Currently, our Bleecker System is integrated into companies across various industrial verticals to optimize logistics processes.

Snap4City is a 100% open-source platform used in many cities and areas. It is an official FIWARE Platform and Solution (https://www.snap4city.org/467, https://www.fiware.org/) developed under the coordination of DISIT Lab of the University of Florence, Italy. Snap4City is GDPR compliant, passed PENTest, and it is an EOSC platform, an official Node-RED Library, an official E015 API, etc. The platform is provided as a “ Service” basis or installed in your location (by yourself, as well as using a number of companies), no license fee is needed. The platform has at present a wide range of activities in the smart city and IoT/IoE (Internet of Things/Internet of Everything) integrated domains: defining city strategies, implementing control room, realizing ethics and explainable artificial intelligent solutions, and computing key performance indicators which are used daily in both city and industry management. Snap4City has incorporated Km4City (https://www.km4city.org) ontological and semantic model to guarantee the data interoperability with any kind of IoT Devices, device models, data entities, and physical structures ranging from the city, industry, and home. And thus, also with FIWARE Smart Data Models, providing a number of real-time open-source solutions to support decision-makers in cities and large industries to ground their daily operational actions on solid explainable artificial intelligence predictions, deductions, and assessments. It provides a complete understanding of the context and its trends, receiving an early warning, anomaly detections, and performing simulation and what-if analysis. This information is used to suggest strategic interventions to improve city services and general quality of life, in multiple domains (e.g., Smart Cities and Smart Industry). The proposed solution is flexible enough to support extensions at different levels of granularity: data, analytics, tools, applications, MicroServices, and IoT brokers. In this regard, the solution uses FIWARE Orion Broker based on NGSI to connect with a large number of devices thanks to the IoT Directory and Km4City Knowledge base. The solution also developed NGSI compliant IoT Edge of several kinds. Snap4City is also compliant with other protocols and models such as MQTT, AMQP, OneM2M, SigFOX, LoraWAN, and many others.</p>","challenge":"","references":"<p>Snap4City is operative with services and

External providers like the city’s water supplier, transport data providers, social media data, and business startup statistics are all plugged into FIWARE's platform to allow the city itself to guide you as you explore, travel, and work.</p>","challenge":"","references":"<p>Cities all around the world and City Service Providers</p>","awards":"<p>FIWARE Success Story @ https://www.fiware.org/success_stories/ubiwhere</p>","technologies":["Blockchain","Internet of Things"],"domains":["Cities","Logistics","Ports"],"docs":[],"videos":[],"materials":[["FIWARE Article","https://www.fiware.org/2015/11/20/porto-a-city-that-has-become-a-real-time-guide/"],["Shaping Europe’s Digital Future","https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en"],["Porto-News","https://www.porto.pt/pt/noticia/porto-fiware-e-sucesso-no-mundo"]],"additionalText":"","logo":"logo_Ubiwhere.svg","featuredImage":"hero_Ubiwhere_FIWARE_@_UBIWHERE.png","furtherImages":"","related":[{"category":"Powered by FIWARE","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/thumb/hero_Ubiwhere_Urban_Platform.png","excerpt":"Our Urban Platform allows data collection from multiple domains and provides city managers and decision-makers with a holistic view of their cities, presenting cross-domain data in a unified way.","productName":"Urban Platform","companyLink":"./?category=powered&id=ubiwhere-urbanplatform"},{"category":"Powered by FIWARE","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/powered-by-fiware/thumb/hero_Ubiwhere_Smartlamppost.png","excerpt":"Smartlamppost is a modular concept of a lamppost with bleeding edge technology, allowing municipalities to future-proof their smart city and Mobile Network Operators to cost-effectively deploy their 5G solution.","productName":"Smartlamppost","companyLink":"./?category=powered&id=ubiwhere-smartlamppost"}],"hash":"ubiwhere-fiwareubiwhere","member":true,"cat":"services","social":"/support-services/ubiwhere/fiware---ubiwhere.html","img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/support-services/logo/logo_Ubiwhere.svg","featuredImageUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/showcase/support-services/hero/hero_Ubiwhere_FIWARE_@_UBIWHERE.png"},"robertocerveróciudad-excontrolfiwareintegrationservices":{"category":"Services","organisationName":"Roberto Cerveró Ciudad","productName":"ExControl FIWARE integration services","organisationWebsite":"https://excontrol.es/","organisationEmail":"mailto:info@excontrol.es","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/88949859/admin/","twitter":"","productWebsite":"https://excontrol.es/","excerpt":"Automation company that develops custom solutions using new technologies, such as IoT, AI, Artificial vision, etc. We offer solutions both in the domestic and industrial fields, paying special attention to making processes more efficient.","yearOfValidation":2023,"description":"<p>We offer custom solutions for our clients, to whom we offer our experience and knowledge in the field of automation and digital transformation.
