Whether moving into data sharing or robotics, growing customer need dictates that context brokers must keep up with consumer demand and be able to offer prototypical versions of novel features for assessment and use. </p> <p>The aim of this webinar is to showcase some experimental features of the Orion-LD context broker showing how its syntax, transports and endpoints can be adapted. These changes can then be contributed to the ETSI CIM committee for further discussion to achieve common operational consensus across brokers and specification changes made offering the potential to broaden the uptake of the official NGSI-LD API itself.</p> <p>Learn how concise payloads and merge-patch updates have been provisionally integrated into the Orion-LD context broker providing an opportunity of innovation before standardization and how to start to use these new features and how to avoid incompatibility clashes against the solid core of the NGSI-LD standard.</p>
