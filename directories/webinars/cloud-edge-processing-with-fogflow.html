   Device orchestration can be boring, repetitive and error-prone, however, FogFlow, with its novel intent-based programming model has turned the tables on this monotony, and created a standard-based data orchestration mechanism.

  <p>Device orchestration can be boring, repetitive and error-prone, however, FogFlow, with its novel intent-based programming model has turned the tables on this monotony, and created a standard-based data orchestration mechanism. It allows IoT solution providers to easily enable the smartness of their connected IoT devices with re-usable and extendable data processing capabilities that can run seamlessly on top of a cloud-edge environment.</p> <p>FogFlow is emerging as a preferred choice within the FIWARE ecosystem to enable cloud-edge computing and digital twins and it can help to reduce the time-to-market of IoT solutions from months to days. This webinar will introduce the key features of FogFlow and also showcases how to integrate FogFlow with other FIWARE Generic Enablers across a variety of use cases.</p>
