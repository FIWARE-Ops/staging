The use case covered involves getting data from different sources/organizations  for real-time inference with a trained ML model. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This webinar is your chance to learn the end-to-end implementation of the real-time inference AI service: ML Training,  Docker setup, creating a Python Package, and implementing the ML API.&lt;/p&gt;",

No new frameworks and protocols should need to be built when existing technologies such as FIWARE are readily available and in common use. The fundamental technologies underpinning the process of data sharing are the use of a common trustworthy security framework -identifying participants and roles- and a common structured definition of payloads and protocols to be used when transferring data between trusted parties. A Local Expert in B2B Data Sharing should be able to explain the need for such frameworks and deeply understand how they operate and how the network of trust and interoperability.  is created.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The webinar explains the role and background required for an LEBDS and provides a walkthrough of the certification  process and explains how it is run and how to study to take the exam.&lt;/p&gt;",

However what can you do if the tourists you attract don&#x27;t speak the local language? Also many regions are multilingual and therefore require support for their own infrastructure in a variety of local languages. NGSI-LD recognises underlying multi-language support is a need for many such context-driven systems and the current ETSI specification now offers language properties which define a standardized language support mechanism based on JSON-LD syntax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This webinar will discuss the latest specification changes and go into details as to what context brokers can and cannot do, and describe the use of best practices for localizing and internationalizing smart data models&lt;/p&gt;",

Once defined, the policies must be enforced using appropriate software tools. This webinar demonstrates the potential of using API Umbrella for access control across a FIWARE-based system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;API Umbrella is an open source API management tool incorporating both Policy Enforcement Point and Policy Decision Point functions which allows users to track and control API usage through API Keys and JSON Web Tokens. It also offers additional features such as rate limiting, API usage analytics and caching. During the webinar we will present the core functions of API umbrella and give examples on how to protect your APIs based on API Keys and tokens.

The SOSS-FIWARE, based on the eProsima Integration Service, is a key enabler that accelerates the development of these interfaces between micro-ROS and FIWARE ecosystems. Through a basic application, the main features of this component as well as the key concepts associated with the synergies between FIWARE and micro-ROS will be overviewed.&lt;/p&gt;",
