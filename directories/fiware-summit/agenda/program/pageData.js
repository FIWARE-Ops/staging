Fragmented cybersecurity practices and limited visibility between providers hinder timely and coordinated responses to attacks,  making cities increasingly attractive targets. In this session, we explore how urban stakeholders can collectively anticipate,  detect, and respond to multi-domain cyber threats—shifting from isolated defense strategies to proactive, collaborative  security operations. We will also examine how different development environments are enabling broader adoption  of interoperable, secure smart city applications. These approaches help bridge technical complexity, integrate semantic  data models, and embed security by design, laying the foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and citizen-focused urban innovation.</p>","excerpt":"As Smart Cities evolve into highly interconnected ecosystems, their complexity creates new vulnerabilities,  especially across digital supply chains where threats can propagate silently through weak links.","publish":true,"moderators":[],"speakers":[{"title":"","name":"El Mehdi Erroussafi","surname":"Erroussafi","image":"el-mehdi-erroussafi.jpg","company":"PRISALYA Consulting","companyType":"","website":"https://www.prisalya.com/","job":"CEO","bio":"Elmehdi Erroussafi is the CEO of PRISALYA Consulting, a cybersecurity consulting firm based in Casablanca Morocco, and board member of the Centre Marocain de Recherche Polytechnique et d’Innovation (CMRPI), where he plays a key role in advancing cybersecurity initiatives and research.
