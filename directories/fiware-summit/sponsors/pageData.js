The metropolitan area of Naples is the second most populated in Italy and one of the largest in all of Europe with around 3.8 million people. The whole history of Naples is based on the concept of welcoming foreigners and of different cultures living side by side. The city&#x27;s enviable geographical position half-way down the Italian coast makes it easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The wonderful historical, artistic and archaeological heritage is an intrinsic part of the city. At the same time, we mustn&#x27;t forget its contemporary creative nature which ensures the city always has some new project on the go, some new goal, and plenty of new ideas. Naples is a city on the sea, a place full of light yet with dark, hidden foundations. It has a great cultural and artistic identity which is stamped on the brow of its many museums, castles, churches, squares, narrow streets and archaeological remains. It is a city in which culture, art and &quot;light&quot; mix with the obscure darkness of a hidden, submerged, underground world.&lt;/p&gt;", linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/company/comune-di-napoli/", twitter: "", type: "Hosting Partner" },
