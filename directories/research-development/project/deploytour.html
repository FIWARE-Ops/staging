   Deployment of a trusted and secure Common European Tourism Data Space
  </p>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3> <p>To deploy the European Tourism Data Space, DEPLOYTOUR brings together key actors of the tourism and data ecosystems and their wide geographical coverage of public, business, with special attention to SMEs, and research partner networks at local, national and European levels.. Convinced that tourism data are crucial for the data economy in a European Single Digital Market, DEPLOYTOUR will develop a measurable contribution for the digital transformation of the tourism sector that can significantly strengthen European competitiveness. The project outcomes provide a basis for governance and policy making to foster innovation powered by tourism data and will enable society to make Europe the most desired sustainable space for living and visiting. Based on the previous work of the preparatory actions, DATES and DSFT, together with the experience gathered in other Data Spaces and data sharing initiatives(such as DSSC, Gaia-X, etc.) and in close collaboration with relevant initiatives such as the European Competence Centre to support data in tourism, DEPLOYTOUR will implement the architecture of the ETDS aligned with SIMPL, and will demonstrate the value of the ETDS by piloting 5 strategic use cases that cover diverse tourism destinations and typologies in order to answer key challenges, such as those related to tourism flows, sustainability, new trends, etc. DEPLOYTOUR will continue building upon the previous work done related to governance by developing a minimum viable rulebook, and strengthening the tourism data sharing community, generating synergies, alliances and collaborations. The Interministerial Committee created in DATES will be enlarged to all EU countries. DEPLOYTOUR will generate recommendations for policy-makers and it will develop an exploitation strategy for the project’s results. It will implement a sound communication and dissemination strategy that will support all project’s activities and it will ensure that the ETDS will be know and scale at EU level</p>
