Furthermore, only big farms are proving profitable, keeping young investors skittish. CATTLECHAIN 4.0 aims to develop innovative tools that can restore interest and activity for younger generations, also assuring full transparency of the supply chain. By recording different parameters from the cows and analysing data with artificial intelligence algorithms, farmers are provided with a novel, decision support tool about their livestock.</p> <p>The project will boost the growth of the two industries mainly involved – SENSO, a tech-startup company, and NATRUS, a hamburger company.</p> <h3 id=\"objective\">Objective</h3> <p>Analysis of the Direct Payment Scheme and farm incomes by DG-AGRI shows that on average about 50 % of the European livestock farms are reliant on subsidies. Currently, precision farming is only profitable for big farms and the investment is always difficult to pay back. Besides, there is an increasing demand on more information on food quality and safety and traceability. Thus, the EU livestock sector is in need of innovative tools to (i) increase its efficiency and become an attractive activity for the younger generations and (ii) assure full transparency and traceability along the supply chain.</p> <p>In this context, CATTLECHAIN 4.0 project aims to develop an integral smart solution to support the EU livestock sector to overcome the aforementioned challenges. By recording different parameters from the cows with IoT wearables, and analysing this data with Artificial Intelligence algorithms, farmers get a decision support tool about their farm condition, so they can take immediate action if any issue arises and prevent losses/health issues. Besides, by aggregating the data from multiple cows and farms in a blockchain based cloud platform, consumers and public authorities can access a traceability tool with truthful and secure data about the meat/dairy supply chain. Finally, aligned with consumers’ demands and thanks to the information gather by the IoT wearables, an Animal Welfare Seal will be created that guarantees that the meat and dairy products meet the highest animal welfare standards. This ground-breaking technologies and services will be validated in ambitious trial scenarios with 5.000 cows.</p> <p>The project will boost the growth of the two industries involved, firstly of the coordinator SENSO a tech-startup that will exponentially increase its turnover, and secondly of NATRUS, company specialised in premium hamburguers, who will gain a competitive advantage by being able to completely trace back their products.</p>","program1":"H2020-EU.3. – PRIORITY Societal challenges","program1Link":"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020-EU.3./en","program2":"H2020-EU.3. – H2020-EU.2.1. – INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP – Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies","program2Link":"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020-EU.2.1./en","topic":"EIC-FTI-2018-2020 – Fast Track to Innovation (FTI)","topicLink":"https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_EIC-FTI-2018-2020/en","publish":true,"year":"2019","social":"/project/cattlechain.html","contacts":true,"img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/research-development/images/cattlechain.png","flagUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/people/images/flag/flag_Europe.png"},

On the one hand, the project uses the possibilities of the new mobile communications technology, which has been available in Etteln since the end of 2021, and also contributes to the digital participation of the citizens in the village. In addition, the village will become more resilient to environmental changes and pandemics, as we have been experiencing since February 2020.</p> <p>The holistic approach of the project supports its innovative character. The Open Data platform, as well as the use of open-source, standard interfaces and data models prevents the realisation of data silos and allows for easy transferability to other places in the rural area. In the project, the experiences and results (i.e., best practices and lessons learned) will be actively thus supporting Etteln’s claim to be a digital model village. For this purpose, the project, a step-by-step approach is chosen: First, the experiences and solutions from Etteln will be shared with other Borchen communities as a blueprint, before subsequently communities in the region will be addressed and, finally, a nationwide transfer will take place.</p>","program1":"Land.Funk Anwendungen von Gigabit-Netzen für ländliche Räume","program1Link":"https://www.ble.de/DE/Projektfoerderung/Foerderungen-Auftraege/BULE/Foerdermassnahmen/Modellprojekte/LandFunk.html","publish":true,"year":"2022","social":"/project/didoz-etteln.html","contacts":true,"img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/research-development/images/didoz.png","flagUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/people/images/flag/flag_Germany.png"},

These Digital Twins are an important basis for building advanced XR applications for cityscapes and the industrial environments. These XR applications need high-fidelity models for accurate localization, which are kept in-sync with the real world. However, currently (i) creating high-fidelity Digital Twins is costly, (ii) integrating data from heterogeneous sensors is still challenging and (iii) the update of Digital Twins requires explicit manual intervention.</p> <h3 id=\"objective\">Objective</h3> <p>The vision of DIDYMOS-XR is to enable advanced, more realistic and more dynamic extended reality (XR) applications, powered through artificial intelligence. The project thus focuses on advancing technologies for creating large-scale digital twins, synchronised with the real world. DIDYMOS-XR will research and develop methods for reconstruction and mapping from heterogeneous inputs, including static and mobile sensors, AI-based data fusion, scene understanding and rendering. Digital twin based XR applications also require means of accurately positioning in the environment, aware of the dynamics of the scene, also addressed by the project. The capture of scenes at scale, as well as using cameras and other sensor data for synchronising the digital representation, bears the risk of capturing personal and sensitive data. Hence, the technologies resulting from DIDYMOS-XR must be and will be ethical and privacy-aware by design.</p> <p>In order to demonstrate and validate the enabling technologies researched and developed in DIDYMOS-XR, the project will address use cases of XR applications in two domains that differ in their scale and characteristics.

Bad data kills good services, and bad services may kill people, the planet and the prosperity of communities on all levels.  The data space for smart communities is different from the classical sectorial data spaces in that it is not focused on a single domain, sector or profession. It is territorial, place-based.

The purpose of this platform is to facilitate the opening up, interoperability and utilisation of existing relevant services in order to bring them together and make them marketable, following the example of a marketplace in new, international, smart mobility services.</p> <p>The SmartMaaS platform builds on domain-neutral FIWARE infrastructures and technologies developed under EU funding programs as a service-oriented generic services platform. In addition to application management functions, it also offers management functions. These functionalities are supplemented with standardised technologies from the semantic web as well as linked data approaches.</p> <h3 id=\"thedigitaltransformationofeuropeanindustry\">The digital transformation of European industry</h3> <p>Smart MaaS builds an open platform for integrated mobility and a reference topology for the smart platform in the area of integrated mobility in cities and regions, building on extensive preparatory work by the consortium partners and their specific expertise. This is the basis for scalable MaaS (mobility as a service) in cities, communities and regions. The project is driven by a strong focus on the actual and concrete needs of cities and regions as well as new and established transport operators, and will therefore cooperate intensively and collaboratively with the relevant market players.</p> <p>The SmartMaaS platform will enable existing, previously largely isolated, often fragmented data sources and applications to be securely combined and marketed using FIWARE and semantic web technologies as standards-compliant web services, and in any environment.</p> <p>The SmartMaaS platform makes it much easier for external APP developers to implement new ideas, applications, and business models based on the platform. Furthermore, legacy business models and specific markets continue to be supported without major changes to existing software structures, as FIWARE technologies are a platform for platforms. The technical merger of the isolated platforms into a unified portal supports the federal municipal structure, allowing local providers easy and barrier-free access to important data infrastructures, as well as the portability of the solutions to other cities as well as service structures and markets.</p>","program1":"Smart Services Worlds","program1Link":"https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/EN/Textbausteine/buehnen_element_doorpage_smart-service-welt_1.html","publish":true,"year":"2018","social":"/project/smart-maas.html","contacts":true,"img":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/research-development/images/smart-maas.png","flagUrl":"https://www.fiware.org/wp-content/directories/people/images/flag/flag_Germany.png"},

It will consolidate, activate and extend the current ecosystem by building a network of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) that will boost the uptake of digital solutions by the farming sector. This will be achieved by integrating technology and business support in a local one-stop-shop approach involving all regions and all relevant players in Europe.</p> <p>The heart of the project is formed by 28 flagship innovation experiments demonstrating digital innovations in agriculture, facilitated by DIHs from 9 Regional Clusters including all European member states. Concurrently, SmartAgriHubs will improve the maturity of innovation services of DIHs so that digital innovations will be replicated across Europe and widely adopted by European farmers.</p> <p>A lean multi-actor approach focusing on user acceptability, stakeholder engagement and sustainable business models will boost technology and market readiness levels and bring user adoption to the next level. This will be enhanced by synergetic effects between SmartAgriHubs and RIS3, since SmartAgriHubs will work in lock step with European regions to maximise the return of European investments, including regional structural funds and private capital.</p> <p>Open Calls with a total budget of ±6 M€ will expand the network and ensure that technological developments and emerging challenges of the agri-food sector are incorporated in the DIH service portfolio.
