	<h1>Cities Climate Action Summit 2024</h1>
   <p>Cities Climate Action Summit (CCAS24) is the leading event focused exclusively on climate action in cities. FIWARE is proud to partner with Smart Cities World in the Cities Climate Action Summit 2024 (26-27 June) leading the way in smart and sustainable city development. Open-source technologies and open standards are at the core of the FIWARE approach, enabling efficient and environmentally conscious urban development.</p> <p>FIWARE has a lot to say about climate -- and not only to say. The FIWARE Community recognizes that climate change is impacting societies, economies, and especially humans' daily lives. Today, FIWARE Community already proudly presents a wide portfolio of very concrete applications and solutions based on Open Source and Open Standards with a direct positive impact on climate change and urban sustainability.</p> <p>The main themes of this year's event are policy development, climate finance and technology deployment. The built environment is crucial for sustainability as cities around the world face the dual challenges of rapid urbanisation and climate change. Buildings and infrastructure have a major impact on energy use, emissions, and urban resilience, and this year's Cities Climate Action Summit highlights the built environment as a key theme. The Summit gathers city leaders, policymakers, urban planners, and technology leaders to discuss innovative strategies for making the built environment a vital part of climate action.</p> <p>As the only city-focused event during London Climate Action Week, CCAS24 will be driving change for cities by sharing knowledge, inspiration, experience and strategies through the line-up of senior speakers and influencers from across the globe.</p> <p>There will be plenty of opportunity to network with forward thinking city leaders, innovative policy makers, green finance experts and technology pioneers.</p> <p>Join Cities Climate Action Summit together with FIWARE on 26 (online) and 27 June ( London, England) -- because together, we can drive transformative change for our cities and the planet.</p>
