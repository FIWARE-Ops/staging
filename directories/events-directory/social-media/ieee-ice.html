	<h1>IEEE ICE</h1>
   <p>ICE IEEE/ITMC is the International Conference on Engineering, Technology, and Innovation, part of the IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society (TEMS). It developed from an early focus on the engineering approach of concurrent engineering to the general organisation of the engineering process and its organization within the corporation and in networks.</p> <p>The ICE conference, therefore, discusses systems engineering as a socio-technical task focusing on the design of products and services, and the entrepreneurial innovation process, and adoptions of digital technologies and methods supporting the process of organizational digital transformation in society and the economy. By integrating academic research with industry perspectives, the ICE IEEE/ITMC offers participants the opportunity to explore the latest trends in engineering and digital transformation management, discuss best practices, and engage in forward-thinking discussions on the role of technology in shaping the future.</p> <p>FIWARE Chief Architect &amp; Tech Lead Fernando LÃ³pez as Technical Project Coordinator of CoGNETs project will participate in the joint special session Titled: SS14: Cognitive Computing Continuum at the IEEE ICE/ ITMC conference, which is being organised in Valencia, Spain from 16th June 2025 representing CoGNETs project. The ICE/ITMC conference provides the opportunity to explore the latest trends in engineering and digital transformation management, discuss best practices, and engage in forward-thinking discussions on the role of technology in shaping the future. FIWARE Foundation will make a CoGNETs presentation followed by an open/panel discussion to help identify synergies, areas of knowledge/technology exchange and potential collaborations on project tasks and proposals together with the other Cognitive Computing Continuum EC funded projects.</p>
