	<h1>KEY: The Energy Transition Expo</h1>
   <p>KEY 2025 is the biggest edition ever of IEG´s (Italian Exhibition Group) energy transition and efficiency event of reference in Europe, Africa and the Mediterranean basin, about 350 hosted buyers and delegations from more than 50 countries are expected at Rimini Expo Centre from 5th to 7th March with North Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans and Eastern Europe the most represented areas.</p> <p>KEY25 extends and strengthens its transversal vision, consolidating its role as a reference network for the global energy transition and efficiency community, able to gather together all the sector´s stakeholders, and favour meetings, comparisons and dialogue with the institutions with the aim of creating a system and contributing to the identification of shared solutions to accelerate decarbonisation. The event also provides a privileged opportunity for companies looking for solutions to contain energy costs, rationalise their consumption and reduce the energy and environmental impact of their activities, as well as to learn about the latest innovations and technologies available on the market.</p> <p>On <strong>March 7th</strong>, Gernot Boege, Senior Tech Expert – Data Spaces, will proudly present FIWARE Foundation as a speaker at the Pannel discussion “The missing link: circular economy for the energy transition” and will present the strategies on how to turn digital battery passports into a transformative blueprint for transparent, key findings and lessons learned from the Battery Pass project to be ready for the EU Battery Passport.</p> <p>The panel will explore the challenges and opportunities related to the recovery and reuse of critical resources needed for renewable technologies. In a context where the European Union aims to strengthen strategic independence and achieve the ambitious Green Deal targets, recycling of batteries and other critical components plays a key role. With the European Battery Regulation, the EU aims to ensure 95 percent recycling for cobalt, copper, lead and nickel, and 70 percent recycling for lithium by 2030, and to increase the use of secondary materials, reducing dependence on imports of critical raw materials. During the panel, industry experts will discuss emerging technologies, industry best practices, and the contribution these solutions make to a circular economy, highlighting how sustainable resource management can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon energy future.</p> <p>Join the panel together with FIWARE experts and other industry leaders:</p> <p>When: <strong>March 7th. 10 -11.30 am.</strong>  Location: Rimini Expo Centre, Italy – Diotallevi 2 Room, South Hall</p>
