	<h1>FIWARE Workshop: Trusted Data Exchanges: From Standards to Pilots in a changing world</h1>
   <p>This workshop aims to explore practical implementation of trusted data exchanges, supporting the Memorandum of Cooperation on digital identities and trust services signed between the EU and Japan. This initiative builds on commitments made at the G7 Hiroshima 2023, where the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership (IAP) was endorsed to operationalize Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT). In 2024, the OECD released the G7 Mapping Exercise of Digital Identity Approaches, analyzing commonalities between different frameworks, including those of the EU and Japan, and calling for pilot projects to test key standards. </p> <p>Both personal and non-personal data exchanges will be considered as the discussions will explore how digital identities and data provenance traceability serve as key enablers for trusted data flows. To steer the discussion with scenarios, the session will consider risk and crisis management situations for which trusted data exchanges are mandatory for preparedness, and response strategies.</p> <p>CEO FIWARE Foundation Chandra Challagonda will share insights into FIWARE’s role in promoting open standards for trusted data exchange platforms. Presentation of the reference implementation initiative.</p>
