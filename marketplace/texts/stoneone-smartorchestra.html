<p>The SmartOrchestra platform is designed to address the current gap in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, which lacks a universal operating system capable of integrating and orchestrating diverse cyber-physical systems (CPS) and technologies. This platform provides a comprehensive solution for setting up marketplaces that connect and integrate encapsulated CPS, such as sensors and actuators, as SmartServices. Utilizing FIWARE technology, including the FIWARE Context Broker, SmartOrchestra ensures efficient data management and memory for these devices.</p><p>One of the primary use cases of the SmartOrchestra platform is its ability to enable a uniform service description and secure internet-based composition and integration of heterogeneous CPS and services. This is achieved through standardized cloud and orchestration technologies, making it possible to safely combine and orchestrate smart services for various cyber-physical applications. The platform's open nature allows for the effective marketing of these services, aiming to create a standardized service platform for both public administrative and business-related services.</p><p>SmartOrchestra leverages the concept of a trustworthy marketplace to design, provide, and market services. It facilitates the integration of existing stand-alone CPS solutions and aggregated sensor data, along with actuator/control functionalities, offering them as component services to third parties. This approach opens up new possibilities for innovative solutions, such as smart waste management systems. For instance, smart waste containers can transmit their fill level data to municipal waste collection services, enabling more efficient and economical waste management compared to traditional fixed schedules.</p><p>The platform serves as both a transparent catalog for evaluating suitable services and an operational interface between control devices and sensor units with their applications. By doing so, SmartOrchestra establishes itself as an open, secure, and standardized Smart Service Platform. It combines the functionalities of an operational platform, a marketplace, a broker, and a notary for cloud-based operations. This flexibility allows users of cyber-physical systems to choose their control applications freely, without being restricted to the manufacturer's software, whether they are using a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer.</p><p>SmartOrchestra's marketplace offers general user interfaces based on generic APIs, facilitating software usage across multiple devices. This capability ensures the secure connection and combination of cyber-physical applications as Smart Services, their orchestration, and effective marketing. As a result, the platform supports the development of new and smart business models, providing a robust foundation for the future of IoT and CPS integration.</p>
