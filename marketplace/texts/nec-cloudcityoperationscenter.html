<div>    <p>The NEC Cloud City Operations Centre (CCOC) platform serves as the central intelligence of a smart city, designed to enhance service transformation through the integration and analysis of big data sourced from various origins such as historical databases, IoT sensors, and CCTV. This platform is pivotal in enabling cities to manage, interpret, and automate responses to the data collected across urban environments, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and efficient information dissemination to city inhabitants.</p>        <p>The City Operations Centre Predictive Analytics service is a managed service that includes a suite of CCOC modules. These modules empower clients to create tailored data visualizations based on specific use cases. Key modules of the CCOC platform include:</p>        <ul>        <li><strong>Dashboard (Content Management System):</strong> This module is widget-based and can be configured to display a customizable subset of data in various formats. It also features alarm generation capabilities, enhancing the platform's responsiveness to critical events.</li>                <li><strong>Big Data Storage:</strong> This component is responsible for handling and processing vast amounts of data from IoT devices, transforming them into valuable aggregated insights. It supports both real-time analyses and historical data management.</li>                <li><strong>IoT Broker:</strong> This module facilitates connectivity with any IoT device, free from protocol or communication constraints, ensuring seamless data integration.</li>                <li><strong>ESB (Enterprise Service Bus):</strong> It connects to legacy systems, such as OSS/BSS, and any application using existing APIs and interfaces, ensuring interoperability across diverse systems.</li>                <li><strong>Streaming Media Server:</strong> This server manages video streaming on the platform, supporting real-time visual data processing.</li>                <li><strong>Real-Time Processing Engine:</strong> This engine processes all events online, enabling swift actions based on real-time data.</li>                <li><strong>API:</strong> This interface exposes all data to upper layers, allowing for enhanced data utilization and integration with other systems.</li>                <li><strong>Publish/Subscription Notification Engine:</strong> This feature allows systems or interfaces to subscribe only to the information they are interested in, optimizing data flow and relevance.</li>                <li><strong>BPM & BRE (Rules and Workflows Engines):</strong> These engines facilitate the creation of rules and workflows that automate manual processes, increasing operational efficiency.</li>                <li><strong>Analytics and Prediction Engine:</strong> Utilizing algorithms, this engine analyzes past events to understand causality, predicts future occurrences, and prescribes actionable measures.</li>                <li><strong>BI (Business Intelligence):</strong> This tool generates KPI reports for city analytics, with export options in multiple formats such as HTML, PDF, and Excel, supporting comprehensive data analysis and reporting.</li>    </ul>        <p>All these tools and data are accessible through a consolidated, user-friendly web-based interface. The NEC CCOC platform is developed in accordance with industry standards, specifically FIWARE, which facilitates easy integration with other or third-party systems. This ensures that cities can leverage existing infrastructure while adopting new technologies, promoting a seamless transition to smarter urban management.</p></div>
