<p>The Thinking Cities platform is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance city services by leveraging data acquisition, processing, storage, and distribution. It supports the implementation of various city services, vertical IoT solutions, and data analytics, all built on the standards and interfaces of the European FIWARE initiative. The platform's functionality revolves around the data lifecycle and client-related aspects, categorized into four main use cases: data insertion, data transformation, data querying, and data sending.</p><p>1) <strong>Data Insertion:</strong> This involves acquiring data from sensors and external systems to be stored on the platform. The IoT Agents module plays a crucial role here by collecting observations from devices and converting them into NGSi events for the Context Broker, enabling applications to consume this information and send commands to devices.</p><p>2) <strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Operations are performed on the platform to generate new data from the available information. The Context Broker (Orion) is central to this process, managing context information and providing NGSI interfaces. The NGSI Data Adapter (Cygnus) processes data from the Context Broker, adapting it for various platform sinks like MySQL, CKAN, Hadoop, or Mongo.</p><p>3) <strong>Data Querying:</strong> This involves visualizing and extracting stored data, either by end-users or other modules. The Open Data Portal (CKAN) facilitates the management and publication of data collections, widely used by governments and organizations. The Short-term Historic (STH) module allows for the storage and retrieval of processed data, both raw and aggregated. The Analytical Database (ADB) makes internal data available to the presentation layer, while the Business Intelligence (BI) component serves as the main part of this layer.</p><p>4) <strong>Data Sending:</strong> Notifications or commands are sent as a result of data entry or administrative tasks. The Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL, ESB) tools handle data from external sources, transforming it for compatibility with the platform. The Complex Event Processor (CEP) analyzes real-time event data, providing immediate insights and enabling quick responses to changing conditions. The Big Data Analysis (Hadoop) framework supports large-scale data storage and processing.</p><p>Additional components include the Identity Manager, Policy Enforcement, and Policy Administration (IDM&AUTH) for identity management, authentication, and authorization. The Administration Portal offers a user interface for managing services, sub-services, users, entities, devices, subscriptions, and rules.</p><p>Overall, the Thinking Cities platform provides a robust infrastructure for smart city management, enabling efficient data handling and service delivery. Its modular design ensures flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for various urban environments and applications.</p>
