<div>    <p>KNOWAGE is a versatile open-source suite designed for analytics and business intelligence, offering comprehensive solutions for both traditional data sources and modern cloud/big data systems. It is fully compliant with FIWARE architecture and General Enablers (GEs), making it a robust choice for organizations looking to leverage data visualization and analytics in line with NGSI standards.</p>        <p>The suite is structured around two main modules, each catering to different analytical needs:</p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Smart Intelligence (SI):</strong> This module focuses on traditional business intelligence tasks, such as self-service and ad-hoc reporting on structured data. It empowers users to create their own analyses and explore data autonomously within a secure and managed environment.</li>        <li><strong>Enterprise Reporting (ER):</strong> This module is designed for producing and distributing static reports with pixel-perfect, ready-to-print layouts. It ensures secure dissemination of information, meeting enterprise-level requirements for data consistency and reliability.</li>    </ul>        <p>To enhance the capabilities of the Smart Intelligence module, KNOWAGE offers four specialized plug-ins:</p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Smart Data (SD):</strong> This plug-in allows users to combine Solr index with other data sources, providing faceted views and enabling full-text search capabilities. It is ideal for users who need to integrate and analyze diverse data sets.</li>        <li><strong>Location Intelligence (LI):</strong> By combining business data with spatial or geographical information, this plug-in facilitates advanced data visualization through mashup techniques. It is particularly useful for organizations that require geospatial analysis.</li>        <li><strong>Performance Management (PM):</strong> This plug-in focuses on managing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with thresholds and organizing scorecards. It also supports real-time alerts, making it a valuable tool for performance tracking and management.</li>        <li><strong>Custom Analytics (CA):</strong> This plug-in enhances analytical capabilities by allowing users to incorporate what-if scenarios and leverage R/Python for advanced data processing and analysis. It is perfect for users who need to perform complex data manipulations and predictive analytics.</li>    </ul>        <p>KNOWAGE stands out by offering high customization capabilities, allowing end-users to tailor their analytical environment to their specific needs. This flexibility supports a bi-modal approach, where rapid development is balanced with enterprise requirements for data integrity and reliability.</p>        <p>Moreover, as an open-source solution, KNOWAGE can be used independently or integrated into third-party applications, adding significant value through embedded analytics. Its adherence to open standards ensures that it can be seamlessly incorporated into existing systems, providing organizations with a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.</p></div>
