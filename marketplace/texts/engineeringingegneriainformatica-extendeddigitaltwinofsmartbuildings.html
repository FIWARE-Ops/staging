<div>    <p>The solution facilitates the swift creation of an "eXtended Digital Twin" (XDT) for buildings, offering a suite of accelerators for device management at the edge, data mashup, and harmonization using Smart Data Models. It also includes AI-based information deduction, BIM import, and rendering of Building Digital Twins.</p>    <p>The XDT solution is built on the Digital Enabler, Engineering's ecosystem platform, with key features such as:</p>    <ul>        <li>An open, highly scalable cloud platform.</li>        <li>APIs and connectors for integrating diverse data sources, including sensors, user feedback, and third-party applications.</li>        <li>Advanced device management capabilities both in the cloud and at the edge.</li>        <li>Algorithms for enhancing energy efficiency, assessing perceived well-being within the building, and evaluating property sustainability, along with deducing new insights from collected data.</li>        <li>A dedicated web app for energy managers, HR managers, and facility managers to manage the building's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) aspects.</li>        <li>Standards, interoperability, and security by design, achieved through the use of FIWARE and Smart Data Models.</li>    </ul>    <p>The primary advantage of an XDT over BIM (Building Information Modeling) is the dynamic interaction between the physical reality and the virtual model. While BIM includes the geometrical and temporal data of a physical entity, it requires manual updates due to the absence of a direct link with the physical entity. In contrast, a digital twin enables real-time interaction between the physical and virtual models. IoT technologies and sensors facilitate a bidirectional flow of information, allowing the virtual model to be updated with live data from the physical counterpart. This capability enables simulations on the virtual model, allowing for future forecasting and optimization of the building's performance, ultimately enhancing the physical entity's efficiency.</p>    <p>In the XDT framework, data collection at the edge is managed by a component of the Digital Enabler called the IoT Device Manager. This component integrates devices from various vendors (e.g., Schneider and Bticino) and supports the edge computing model. A lightweight module is deployed near the sensors, collecting data using a variety of IoT-specific protocols such as Modbus, BacNet, and MQTT. The IoT Device Manager incorporates all FIWARE IoT Agents.</p>    <p>Once data is collected from the edge, it undergoes harmonization using a no-code, graphical approach. The Digital Enabler's Data Mashup Editor processes and harmonizes the data, representing it in NGSI-LD format using Smart Data Models. After harmonization, the data is analyzed both at the edge and in the cloud. Edge analysis is crucial for rapid responses, while cloud analysis is suited for historical data analysis, AI model training, and other resource-intensive tasks.</p>    <p>By leveraging environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, indoor pollution, irradiance), the solution can deduce insights about indoor comfort and occupant productivity. These insights are displayed in the building's Digital Twin, utilizing AI-based algorithms to enhance understanding and management of the building environment.</p></div>
