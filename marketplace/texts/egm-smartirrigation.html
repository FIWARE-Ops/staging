<div>    <p>EGM provides a comprehensive solution aimed at optimizing water usage in green spaces by integrating with existing watering systems. This solution is designed to assess and control water consumption, ensuring that water is used efficiently and effectively. The initial deployment of this system resulted in a 35% reduction in water usage, highlighting its potential for significant water savings.</p>        <h2>Assessment</h2>    <p>The core of EGM's solution is the precise assessment of water needs based on the actual requirements of the grass. This approach addresses the common issue of over-watering, which not only wastes water but can also harm the health of the grass. By accurately determining the necessary amount of water, the system helps in conserving water resources and maintaining the health of the green space.</p>        <h2>Solutions</h2>    <p>The solution comprises several key components:</p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Humidity Sensors:</strong> These sensors are installed on the ground to monitor soil moisture levels. They provide real-time data that is crucial for making informed decisions about watering schedules.</li>        <li><strong>Interoperable Context Broker Stellio:</strong> This component is used to contextualize the data collected by the sensors. It enables the creation of an automated watering schedule that adjusts based on the current conditions and needs of the grass, ensuring optimal water usage.</li>    </ul>        <h2>Return on Investment (ROI)</h2>    <p>The implementation of EGM's solution offers several benefits that contribute to a strong return on investment:</p>    <ul>        <li><strong>Water Consumption Savings:</strong> The system can achieve up to 30% savings in water consumption. This reduction not only lowers water bills but also contributes to environmental conservation efforts.</li>        <li><strong>Simplified Maintenance Operations:</strong> By automating and remotely controlling various equipment such as mowers and sprinklers, the solution simplifies maintenance tasks. This automation reduces the need for frequent manual interventions, thereby saving time and labor costs.</li>        <li><strong>Improved Ground Quality:</strong> The precise control of watering and maintenance operations leads to better quality grounds. This improvement reduces the need for additional interventions such as fertilization and mechanical operations, further lowering maintenance costs and efforts.</li>    </ul>        <p>Overall, EGM's solution not only provides significant water savings but also enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of green space maintenance. By leveraging technology to monitor and control water usage, it offers a sustainable approach to managing green spaces, benefiting both the environment and the bottom line.</p></div>
