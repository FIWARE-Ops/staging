<p>EGM provides an innovative solution designed to optimize water usage in green spaces, offering significant water savings and enhancing the efficiency of existing watering systems. The product's initial deployment demonstrated a remarkable 35% reduction in water usage, showcasing its potential for substantial resource conservation.</p><p><strong>Use Cases</strong></p><p><strong>1. Water Consumption Assessment</strong></p><p>One of the primary use cases for EGM's solution is the assessment of water consumption in green spaces. By accurately determining the real water needs of the grass, the system helps eliminate the common issue of over-watering. This assessment is crucial for municipalities, golf courses, and large estates that aim to manage their water resources more effectively and sustainably.</p><p><strong>2. Automated Watering Solutions</strong></p><p>The solution includes the deployment of humidity sensors on the ground, which are integral to the system's ability to monitor and respond to the specific moisture needs of the soil. These sensors feed data into the Stellio context broker, which contextualizes the information and proposes an automated watering schedule. This automation is particularly beneficial for large-scale operations where manual monitoring and adjustment of watering schedules would be labor-intensive and prone to human error.</p><p><strong>3. Cost Reduction and ROI</strong></p><p>EGM's solution offers a compelling return on investment by reducing water consumption by up to 30%. This reduction translates into significant cost savings on water bills, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious organizations. Additionally, the system simplifies operations associated with maintenance, such as watering, mowing, and fertilization. By automating these processes, the need for manual intervention is minimized, further reducing labor costs and operational complexity.</p><p><strong>4. Enhanced Ground Quality</strong></p><p>Another use case is the improvement of ground quality. By optimizing water usage and reducing unnecessary interventions, the solution helps maintain healthier grass and soil. This results in fewer on-site interventions, such as fertilization and mechanical operations, which can be both costly and disruptive. The improved ground quality also enhances the aesthetic and functional value of the green space, making it more appealing for recreational and professional use.</p><p><strong>5. Environmental Sustainability</strong></p><p>For organizations committed to environmental sustainability, EGM's solution offers a practical way to reduce water waste and promote eco-friendly practices. By conserving water and minimizing the use of fertilizers and other chemicals, the system supports broader environmental goals and helps organizations meet regulatory requirements related to water usage and conservation.</p><p><strong>6. Remote Monitoring and Control</strong></p><p>The system's capability for remote monitoring and control is particularly useful for facilities managers and landscape professionals who oversee multiple sites. With the ability to manage watering schedules and equipment remotely, users can ensure optimal conditions across all locations without the need for constant on-site presence. This feature is especially valuable for organizations with geographically dispersed properties.</p><p>In summary, EGM's solution offers a comprehensive approach to water management in green spaces, providing significant savings, operational efficiencies, and environmental benefits. Its use cases span from water consumption assessment and automated watering to cost reduction, enhanced ground quality, and remote management, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.
