<p>The Urban Data Space Platform (UDSP) is a comprehensive solution designed to address the challenges of data integration and management in urban environments. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-source components, UDSP provides a robust data-driven architecture that facilitates the integration of data through standard interfaces, the establishment of processing pipelines, and the creation of interactive work and data spaces. This architecture serves as a foundation for developing innovative data-driven urban services and use cases.</p><p>One of the key advantages of UDSP is its commitment to open-source principles. The platform, along with all its components and scripts, is owned by the customer, ensuring full digital sovereignty. By utilizing open-source building blocks such as the Orion FIWARE Context Broker, UDSP ensures that every line of code is accessible to users without the need for joining associations or signing contracts. This approach aligns with the principle of Everything-as-(OpenSource)Code, allowing users to maintain control over their digital assets both before and after adopting the platform.</p><p>UDSP is developed in accordance with the three key dimensions of Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC): Impact, Integration, and Integrity. The platform exclusively uses open data formats and standardized interfaces, supported by a modular container-based architecture on Kubernetes, the current state-of-the-art system. This design ensures optimal integration, interoperability, and reusability, making the platform highly adaptable to various urban data needs. Additionally, the architecture complies with the German specification DIN SPEC 91357 for urban data platforms, further enhancing its credibility and applicability.</p><p>One of the standout features of UDSP is its ability to preserve the digital sovereignty of municipalities. The platform empowers users to implement their own use cases through "low-code" approaches, reducing the need for extensive technical expertise. While full-service operation and use case implementation by Hypertegrity are available, they are not mandatory, giving users the flexibility to manage their data solutions independently.</p><p>The platform offers a range of functions that cater to diverse urban data requirements. These include:</p><ul>  <li><p>Right-time processing of sensor data, geodata, or files, enabling timely and accurate data analysis and decision-making.</p></li>  <li><p>Context management, which allows for the effective organization and utilization of data within its relevant context.</p></li>  <li><p>Flexible API management with a low-code approach, simplifying the integration and management of various data sources and services.</p></li>  <li><p>Customizable dashboards that provide users with the ability to tailor data visualization and reporting to their specific needs.</p></li>  <li><p>Geodata visualization, offering advanced tools for mapping and spatial analysis of urban data.</p></li>  <li><p>An Open Data Portal, facilitating the sharing and accessibility of data to the public and other stakeholders.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, the Urban Data Space Platform is a versatile and powerful tool for municipalities and urban planners seeking to harness the potential of data-driven solutions. By providing a flexible, open-source, and user-friendly platform, UDSP enables the development of innovative urban services that can address the unique challenges and opportunities of modern cities.</p>
