<p>The Scalable Smart Analytic Application Builder for Sentient Cities is a versatile platform designed to facilitate the rapid development of smart city applications. It leverages heterogeneous data and integrates services for stakeholders through IoT/IoE, data analytics, and big data technologies. As cities evolve to tackle societal, environmental, and economic challenges, there is a shift from vertical smart solutions to more comprehensive systems that utilize a wide array of data channels. This transformation requires solutions that are not only innovative but also capable of integrating legacy systems while pushing towards future advancements.</p><p>Snap4City, a 100% open-source platform, is at the forefront of this transformation. Developed by the DISIT Lab at the University of Florence, Italy, it is an official FIWARE Platform and Solution. Snap4City is GDPR compliant, has passed PENTest, and is recognized as an EOSC platform. It is also part of the official Node-RED Library and E015 API. The platform can be deployed as a service or installed locally without any licensing fees, making it accessible and cost-effective for cities and organizations.</p><p>The platform supports a wide range of activities within the smart city and IoT/IoE domains. It aids in defining city strategies, implementing control rooms, and developing ethical and explainable AI solutions. Snap4City also computes key performance indicators that are crucial for daily city and industry management. By incorporating the Km4City ontological and semantic model, Snap4City ensures data interoperability across various IoT devices, models, and physical structures, including those in cities, industries, and homes. This interoperability extends to FIWARE Smart Data Models, providing real-time open-source solutions that empower decision-makers with reliable AI-driven predictions and assessments.</p><p>Snap4City offers a comprehensive understanding of the context and trends within a city, enabling early warnings, anomaly detection, and simulation capabilities. These features allow for strategic interventions that enhance city services and overall quality of life across multiple domains, such as smart cities and smart industries. The platform's flexibility allows for extensions at various levels, including data, analytics, tools, applications, MicroServices, and IoT brokers.</p><p>To facilitate connectivity with a wide range of devices, Snap4City utilizes the FIWARE Orion Broker based on NGSI, supported by the IoT Directory and Km4City Knowledge base. The platform has also developed NGSI-compliant IoT Edge solutions and is compatible with other protocols and models like MQTT, AMQP, OneM2M, SigFOX, and LoraWAN. This compatibility ensures that Snap4City can integrate seamlessly with existing systems and technologies, providing a robust and adaptable solution for smart city development.</p><p>In summary, the Scalable Smart Analytic Application Builder for Sentient Cities, through Snap4City, offers a dynamic and interoperable platform that supports the creation of smart city applications. It addresses the need for comprehensive data exploitation and service integration, enabling cities to meet current and future challenges effectively. With its open-source nature and extensive compatibility, Snap4City is a valuable tool for cities and industries aiming to enhance their operational efficiency and sustainability.
