<p>The product offered by EGM is a comprehensive solution for transforming an idea into a fully realized product through a user-centered creation process. This process encompasses several stages, including feasibility study, design, prototyping, industrialization, and manufacturing. Each stage is meticulously crafted to ensure that the final product meets the client's performance, price, quantity, standards, mechanical integration, and optimization criteria, while also considering the choice of technologies and manufacturing methods.</p><p><strong>Feasibility Study:</strong> The initial phase involves a thorough feasibility study conducted by EGM's engineering design office. Leveraging their expertise in electronics and embedded IoT, EGM provides technical insights and guidance to assess the viability of the project. This stage is crucial for identifying key development points and determining the best approach to bring the client's idea to fruition. By collaborating closely with the client, EGM ensures that the project is grounded in practical and achievable goals.</p><p><strong>Design:</strong> In the design phase, EGM develops systems either from scratch or by utilizing existing technological components. The process begins with drafting detailed technical specifications in collaboration with the client. Based on these specifications, EGM selects the most suitable components, ensuring that they align with the project's requirements. This stage is pivotal in laying the groundwork for a successful product by establishing a clear blueprint for development.</p><p><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Prototyping is a critical step in the development process, allowing for the creation of an initial electronic prototype (V1). This prototype serves as a tangible representation of the product, enabling both EGM and the client to validate its functionalities and overall concept. Following this, a second version of the prototype (V2) is developed, incorporating any necessary evolutions or modifications identified during the evaluation of the first prototype. This iterative approach ensures that the final product is refined and optimized before moving to the next stage.</p><p><strong>Industrialization and Manufacturing:</strong> EGM's expertise extends to the industrialization and manufacturing phase, where they focus on calibrating and optimizing costs and processes for electronic card manufacturing. Whether the project involves prototypes, small, medium, or large series, EGM offers tailored production plans that align with the client's objectives. This stage is essential for scaling the product from a prototype to a market-ready solution, ensuring that it meets industry standards and is produced efficiently.</p><p>Additionally, EGM supports organizations in deploying FIWARE architectures, which involves managing data from ingestion to processing using new NGSI-LD data models. This capability highlights EGM's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technologies and data management solutions into their product development process.</p><p>Overall, EGM's product offers a robust framework for transforming ideas into tangible solutions, emphasizing a user-centered approach that prioritizes collaboration, technical excellence, and innovation at every stage of the development process. By providing end-to-end support, EGM empowers clients to optimize their work and achieve their project goals effectively.</p>
