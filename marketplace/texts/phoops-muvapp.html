<p>MUV-APP is a comprehensive platform designed to transform urban mobility into a safe, sustainable, and user-friendly system. It offers Mobility as a Service (MaaS) for public administrations, providing innovative tools for managing urban mobility systems. The MUV platform serves both end-users and public administrators, making it a holistic solution for urban mobility. The architecture of MUV is divided into two main sectors: one for the final users and another for mobility management officers, each with distinct modules.</p><p>The modules for mobility users include:</p><ul>  <li><strong>City-Glance:</strong> This module aims to reduce fragmentation among mobility actors and services. It provides users with reliable support for making mobility choices and offers public administrators a comprehensive overview of the local mobility market. City-Glance serves as a single point of access for users and helps municipalities understand the dynamics between mobility supply and demand.</li>    <li><strong>City-Loop:</strong> Focused on enhancing the user experience, City-Loop treats all mobility users as valued customers. It acts as a concierge service, ensuring that user satisfaction is a priority for public administrators. The module emphasizes the importance of treating mobility users as customers to achieve smart mobility.</li>    <li><strong>City-Zen:</strong> This module engages and empowers users by allowing them to provide feedback on mobility conditions, such as traffic jams or crowded buses. Feedback is georeferenced and shared with other users and the municipality. Users can interact with feedback through a "karma" system, which is linked to a rewarding system that recognizes user contributions with seniority levels and rewards.</li>    <li><strong>City-Green:</strong> Designed to support municipalities in promoting low-emission transportation, this module allows users to create profiles with specific trips. Users can track their green trips, and an algorithm validates the data to assign a green score. This score is stored in the user's green profile and can be linked to external reward systems like GreenApes.</li></ul><p>For mobility managers and officers, MUV offers three modules:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Planning Tool:</strong> This module assists in designing and planning urban mobility services and facilities. It provides tools for strategic planning and development of mobility infrastructure.</li>    <li><strong>Management Services:</strong> These services are used to manage the delivery of mobility services to users. They ensure that the mobility system operates efficiently and meets user needs.</li>    <li><strong>MUVâ€™s Analytics:</strong> This module offers features for analyzing and reporting on various aspects of urban mobility dynamics. It provides insights into mobility patterns, helping administrators make informed decisions.</li></ul><p>Overall, MUV-APP is a versatile platform that addresses the needs of both mobility users and public administrators. It enhances user experience, supports sustainable transportation, and provides tools for effective mobility management. By integrating these modules, MUV-APP aims to create a seamless and efficient urban mobility system that benefits all stakeholders involved.</p>
