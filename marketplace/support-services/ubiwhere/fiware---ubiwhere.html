  <h1>Services: Ubiwhere - FIWARE @ UBIWHERE (Blockchain,Internet of Things)</h1>
  <p>
   Ubiwhere’s offer includes systems for Smart Parking and Traffic Management, Smart Waste Management, Smart Environmental Monitoring, Smart Vending and Smart Card, along with its City Control Center, which allows for centralised management of the city’s ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>FIWARE plays a significant role in our Smart City strategy, playing the part of the standardization layer that brings all its Smart Cities’ solutions and data sources together.</p> <p>FIWARE has allowed Ubiwhere to set up a sophisticated Smart City infrastructure powered by standards and interoperable at its core. With pilots beginning to spread throughout Portugal, the first major challenge came with the set-up of Porto (Portugal's second-largest city and a member of OASC) Smart City Node. With the support of Ubiwhere, Porto has been a pioneer city adopting FIWARE standards and together have developed the interfaces bringing access to real-time, contextual environmental data from 75 fixed and mobile units (monitoring stations) located across the city.</p> <p>Scanners installed on the City Council’s 200+ fleet of vehicles enhance the data, creating a large-scale mobile scanner. External providers like the city’s water supplier, transport data providers, social media data, and business startup statistics are all plugged into FIWARE's platform to allow the city itself to guide you as you explore, travel, and work.</p>
