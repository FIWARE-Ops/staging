  <p>
   FIWARE Space is an innovation center, part of a global project called &quot;Badajoz Is More&quot;. This project seeks towards the digitalization of everything around us.
  </p>
  <p><strong>FIWARE Space</strong> is an innovation center, part of a global project called "Badajoz Is More", which is in charge of the Badajoz Provincial Council (Diputación de Badajoz).  This project seeks to incorporate the new information and communication technologies in Local Administrations, to transform rural areas, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, and to achieve a more agile and modern administration. The "Badajoz Is More" project has the clear objective of providing technological tools and services in order to develop municipalities with a better quality of life through sustainable development, based on IoT and Big Data technologies and with the aim of turning the province of Badajoz into a Smart Territory or Smart Province.</p> <p>To achieve this goal we work on different lines of actions:</p> <p>Bring these new technologies to the citizens, developing new services that interact with people in a much closer and intuitive way, and that in general facilitate their daily life as well as allow them to have a much greater knowledge and control of public services that are at their disposal. Improve the efficiency of all the public services that depend on the City Councils of the province and the Provincial Council of Badajoz, developing solutions that optimize the expenditure of resources and centralizing all services in a single smart management platform. Create an innovation ecosystem around these technologies to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation in the region and promote the use of new technologies to develop new services and business opportunities, involving both local businesses and the different educational entities and entrepreneurs of the province. Reduce the digital gap between the cities of the province and the rural area, providing the necessary tools and technologies to all the municipalities of the province and promoting local entrepreneurship based on these to avoid rural exodus and get the population to settle in the smaller municipalities. Develop the project based on standards (both management standards and technology standards) to integrate  other projects related to the Smart Cities carried out or in the development phase within the province or region in the future. Ensure the initiative reaches citizens, companies, public entities, and other organizations, the Badajoz Provincial Council provides training and development of an innovation ecosystem that serves as a meeting point between citizens (who demand these services), entrepreneurs, and educational entities (that have an interest in these technologies), companies (that have the capacity to implement these solutions) and public entities (those that can implement this type of projects) and that provide and provide the necessary tools, knowl edge, and advice so that the projects that arise from this meeting can be carried out.</p> <p>This ecosystem is supported by a physical Innovation Center called FIWARE Space, which focuses on all the activities described above, and the following activities will be carried out:</p> <p>Organization of information events about the technologies used and the concepts of Smart Cities and Smart Province Demonstration and training workshops Organization of Hackathons and call for challenges Showroom and exhibition of models of the different solutions Conferences Presence in congresses, fairs, and national and international events</p> <p>This center is recognized with 2 stars by the FIWARE Foundation.</p>
