  <h1>Services: EGM - Design office (Internet of Things,Sensory Systems)</h1>
  <p>
   From idea (feasibility study, design, prototyping, industrialization and manufacturing)  to realization of your solution: a user-centered creation process. 
You know your work we help you to optimize it!
  </p>
  <p><strong>EGM</strong> ensures the design of your solution taking into account your criteria of performance, price, quantities, standards, mechanical integration, optimization, the choice of technologies, and manufacturing methods with a user-centered creation process.</p> <p><strong>FEASABILITY STUDY</strong>  Our engineering design office offers you its expertise and know-how in electronics and embedded IoT to provide technical  expertise for your project. Based on your idea, EGM will identify the key development points and offer you the best solution to carry out your project.</p> <p><strong>DESIGN</strong>  We develop systems from scratch or  technological bricks. According to the technical specifications that we draft with you, we select the best  components taking into account the requirements of the project.</p> <p><strong>PROTOTYPING</strong>  The development involves the realization of an electronic prototype V1 which allows you  to validate together the functionalities and the concept of your product. Then, we proceed to the electronic prototype V2 which integrates the possible evolutions, or modifications seen previously.</p> <p><strong>INDUSTRIALIZATION AND MANUFACTURING</strong>  Thanks to our skills, we are able to calibrate, optimize costs and electronic card manufacturing processes. Whether for prototypes, small, medium, or large series, we offer production plans adapted to the objectives of our References/Customers. We are supporting organizations in deploying FIWARE architectures, starting from data ingestion up to data processing, with new NGSI-LD data models.</p>
