  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Datakorum Solutions - SC40 (Internet of Things,Cloud Computing)</h1>
  <p>
   This system allows any analog or digital sensor to behave as if it were an IoT sensor and establishes a real-time connection between the cloud and sensors. The measures taken by sensors can be sent instantaneously, and enable events, alerts, and alarms associated with them.
  </p>
  <p>IoT sensor monitoring system allows any analog or digital sensor to behave as if it were an IoT sensor, and establishes a real-time connection between the cloud and sensors. The measures taken by sensors can be sent instantaneously, and enable events, alerts and alarms associated with them.</p> <p>Our controller implements policies that allow minimum data transfer using very low cost M2M lines.</p> <p><strong>SC40</strong> controllers let you connect up to four different sensors to the same controller. It's the cheapest way to implement a sensor network worldwide.</p> <p>Its connection to E3TGlobal CLOUD is via WiFi and user applications are available for PC, Android, and IOS.</p>
