   Remote Control and Monitoring System
PEAK device gives you access to remote control and monitoring of any new or existing streetlight network from one point of light to whole streets.
  </p>
  <p>Our system allows remote control and monitoring of any new or existing streetlight network. This control is achieved by installing one PEAK device just before the lights section we want to command. With one unique device, we can master from one point of light to whole streets.</p> <p><strong>PEAK</strong> line has been thought to transform one point of light into a smart element of the Smart City. With this device in its different configurations, we can control on/off switching, dimming, power consumption measuring, air quality measuring, pollution, noise level, temperature, humidity.</p> <p>In addition to its point of light main electric parameters measuring, the equipment allows failing, blinking, and stealing detection and on/off switching scheduled programming.</p> <p>Datakorum platform allows our devices to establish point-to-point connections with both our cloud and user applications developed by us or third parties. The implementation of MQTTcommunication and MySQL databases allows fast and easy integration with other platforms.</p>
