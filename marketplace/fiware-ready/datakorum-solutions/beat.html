  <p>This system allows real-time monitoring of the sound level environment using the built-in sound level meter.</p> <p>The device behaves like an IoT sensor, establishing between it and the cloud a permanent connection. In addition to showing the noise level on the display, it also allows you to send instantaneous measurements in real-time, being able to set events, alerts, and associated alarms.</p> <p>Our controller implements policies that allow a minimum data transfer using LTE-NB communication (NB-IoT).</p> <p>Its connection to Datakorum CLOUD is via LTE-NB (NB-IoT) and user applications are available for PC, Android, and IOS.</p> <p>Datakorum platform allows our devices to establish point-to-point connections with both our cloud and user applications developed by us or third parties. The implementation of MQTTcommunication and MySQL databases allows fast and easy integration with other platforms.</p>
