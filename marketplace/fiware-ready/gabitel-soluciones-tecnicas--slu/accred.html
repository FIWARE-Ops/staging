  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: GABITEL SOLUCIONES TECNICAS, SLU - ACCRED (Interaction Technologies,Logistics,Mobility and Location,Software as a Service)</h1>
  <p>
   ACCRED application is defined as a comprehensive solution that simplifies and automates the external accreditation management process and efficiently and securely organises access to restricted areas.
  </p>
  <p>We start from the premise that there are entities that need to control access to certain spaces in a restricted manner. This type of management requires a system that validates the entry of vehicles, through the recognition of their number plates, and of people, through the use of temporary documents (such as QR codes) or long-term credentials (personalised access cards).</p>
  <p>Contribute significantly to strategic and operational decision-making both internally, by optimising processes within the organisation, and externally, by providing valuable data that can facilitate collaboration with other entities to implement improvements. This approach is particularly reflected in areas like  Predictive Analytics,  Cost Optimisation, Robust Security or Continuous Improvement.</p>
