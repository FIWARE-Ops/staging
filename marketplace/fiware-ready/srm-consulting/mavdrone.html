  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: SRM Consulting - MavDrone (Internet of Things,Data Analytics)</h1>
  <p>
   MavDrone device is the first solution compatible with the MAVLink protocol for the Command and Control of drone fleets. MavDrone extends the capabilities of IAS by publishing the telemetry in a public API.
  </p>
  <p><strong>MavDrone</strong> is an extensión of the already existing solution called Ipsilum Aerial Solution. IAS is a platform developed by SRM Consulting for the Command and Control of Drone Fleets. MavDrone extends the capabilities of IAS by publishing the telemetry in a public API. The API can be consumed by thirdparties through FIWARE. This API allows also sending control messages such us takeoff, landing, flight mode, arm/disarm, and connect/disconnect.</p>
  <p>Current Command and Control Drone Systems are monolithic and isolated solutions. The connectivity between the Ground Control System and the drone is made by a radio-link channel working in an analog channel with serious limitations in communications. The market demands a modularized solution with decentralized services/modules and digital and secure communication systems, in such a way that the Drone Command &amp; Control can be misplaced.</p>
  <p>IAS has been used for several projects in SRM Consulting for mapping and mission monitoring. Also has been used by the Spanish Army, Government of Galicia (Civil UAV Initiative).</p>
