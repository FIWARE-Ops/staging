  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Engineering - KNOWAGE (Artificial Intelligence,Big Data,Data Analytics,Open Data,Software as a Service)</h1>
  <p>
   KNOWAGE  is the professional open-source suite for analytics and business intelligence with any data, fully compliant with FIWARE architecture and GEs.
  </p>
  <p><strong>KNOWAGE</strong> is the professional open-source suite for analytics and business intelligence over traditional sources and cloud/big data systems. KNOWAGE is developed according to the NGSI standards and implements the GE reference for data visualization. KNOWAGE provides two main modules and four plug-ins focused on specific domains, allowing to settle a tailored product for every analytical scope.</p> <p>The modules of the suite are: </p> <ul> <li>SI (smart intelligence) carries out the “usual” business intelligence on structured data, focused on self-service and ad-hoc reporting</li> <li>ER (enterprise reporting) produces and distributes static reports with a pixel-perfect and ready- to-print layout in a secure way</li> </ul> <p>The plug-ins for the SI module are:</p> <ul> <li>SD (smart data) allows to combine Solr index with other data sources and provides faceted views and full-text search.</li> <li>LI (location intelligence) combines business data with spatial or geographical information through mashup techniques.</li> <li>PM (performance management) manages KPIs with thresholds and organizes scorecards with real-time alerts.</li> <li>CA (custom analytics) allows to add what-if capabilities and take full advantage of R/python embedding possibilities.</li> </ul> <p><strong>KNOWAGE</strong> complies the criteria of modern BI, giving high customization capabilities and high autonomy to the end-user, ow able to build his own analysis and explore his own data space, always in a secure and well-managed environment, fully supporting the bi-modal approach where fast development meets enterprise requirements such as data consistency and reliability.</p> <p>Thanks to the open-source model and adoption of open standards, KNOWAGE can be used as-is or easily included in a third-part application giving it new value with embedded analytics.</p>
  <p>Companies and public entities have a lot of data coming from many data sources but often are not able to get full value from the data and experience a lack of information. There is the need to add BI capability to already existing platforms or to adopt a BI solution that is open, innovative, and cross-domain.  It is essential to provide a highly customized experience over data and analyses and present data through an effective data visualization. KNOWAGE enables data visualization over data managed with FIWARE GEs.</p>
