  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Globaltronic - SInGeLu v2 (Communication Networks,Data Analytics,Data Handling,Internet of Things,Sensory Systems)</h1>
  <p>
   SInGeLu v2 is the software that leads your intelligent city, collecting data from connected technology and other available sources. It is able to evaluate the information and reports of the city control centre.
  </p>
  <ul> <li>SInGeLu v2, is a web platform with geo-referencing that integrates systems and is currently focused on lighting, where it manages and controls luminaires and alarms</li> <li>It allows public entities to more efficiently manage their public lighting fleet, their consumption and optimize their energy efficiency.</li> <li>It allows you to manage the regulation of the luminous flux, either individually or in a group, which can be made up of streets, parks, areas, places, etc.</li> <li>It allows the creation of tickets, sending notifications to the indicated users. These tickets can be associated with a status, severity, one or more people responsible, description, comments and attached files.</li> </ul>
  <ul> <li>Challenge to the possibility of dynamic management of flow regulation, depending on the time of day, natural luminosity, its geographical position, the programming sent, the application of sensors and interaction with other applications, with the ultimate objective of energy savings.</li> <li>Challenge for prevention and preventive maintenance, minimizing corrective maintenance. By obtaining operating data, it will allow preventive maintenance actions to be taken, thus minimizing the impact of the failure on the population.</li> <li>Challenge to create interaction with other systems, thus optimizing their integration and aggregation of sensors.</li> <li>Challenge to create special interaction zones between the user and the lighting network, through the application of QRcodes on the roads.</li> </ul>
  <p>Intended for Customers such as:</p> <ul> <li>City Councils</li> <li>Stadiums</li> <li>Sports fields</li> <li>Subway station</li> <li>Historical structures</li> <li>Light shows among others</li> </ul>
