  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: LOBSTA - LOBSTA (Data Handling,Internet Services,Mobility and Location,Software as a Service,Service Architectures)</h1>
  <p>
   LOBSTA is a new Task Management that connects Places and Tasks and helps manage all kinds of location-based tasks collaboratively and more efficiently.
LOBSTA provides an interface to FIWARE to easily create and publish subscriptions and automate task creation based on Context Broker notifications.
  </p>
  <p><strong>LOBSTA</strong> is a location-based task and project management solution for on-site customer services and mobile businesses. LOBSTA provides direct value for any business with location-based tasks and remote workflows. LOBSTA allows customization and optional packages, and one of them is a plugin that integrates with FIWARE deployments. It provides a form-based interface to create and publish FIWARE Context Broker subscriptions and turn Context Broker notifications automated and in real-time into actionable tasks. </p> <p>LOBSTA brings a new usage perspective to many FIWARE deployments. Integrating robust task management capabilities directly with FIWARE provides direct value through its ability to translate real-time context data into actionable tasks.   Some examples of how LOBSTA can be used in combination with FIWARE are:</p> <ul> <li>Smart City Management: Local governments can use the plugin to manage tasks related to urban infrastructure, traffic management, and public services, all driven by real-time data. </li> <li>Environmental Monitoring: Track and respond to environmental changes by automatically creating tasks based on sensor data, ensuring timely interventions. </li> <li>Emergency Response: Improve response times and coordination by creating tasks triggered by real-time incident reports and sensor alerts.</li> </ul>
  <p>Currently, the FIWARE integration of LOBSTA is available as an optional plugin and only supports NGSIv2 standard. </p> <ul> <li>Create and publish FIWARE Context Broker subscriptions </li> <li>Create and update tasks based on FIWARE Context Broker notifications LOBSTA as a hosted service offering is entirely based on Open Source software based on the Redmine project, enhanced with various plugins collected under the GTT-Project: https://gtt-project.org/ </li> </ul> <p>The FIWARE plugin is licensed under GPL-3.0 and the source code is published at https://github.com/gtt-project/redmine<em>gtt</em>fiware Support for NGSI-LD and further enhancements are planned for the upcoming releases.  Customers and contributors are encouraged to support and influence the development of new functionality. </p> <p>By promoting the service through the FIWARE Marketplace we also hope to receive feedback and insight into FIWARE deployments that share suitable use cases.</p>
  <p>The FIWARE plugin is a recent addition to the project/service and there are no customer deployments yet. </p> <p>LOBSTA as a service is used by various organisations in Japan, from port  management to forestry. It also builds the underlying technology of the MyCityReport platform: https://www.mycityreport.jp/</p>
