  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Enerclic Innovation S.L. - CcMaster - Public Light Management (Communication Networks,Internet of Things,Sensory Systems,Software as a Service)</h1>
  <p>
   CcMaster - Public Light Management, offers NB-IoT connectivity and enables supervision and management of scheduled commands for switching the public lighting box on and off according to various scenarios (manual, calendar, astronomical clock). In addition, it allows monitoring of energy consumption.
  </p>
  <p>CcMaster - Public Light Management has a compact size that allows installation in existing public lighting panels (retrofit). It features NB-IoT communications, enabling remote MQTT connection without the need for direct Internet access at the panel. In addition, it includes Ethernet, 2xRS-485, and RS-232 industrial communication ports. Natively, it provides two digital outputs, with the option to expand using an additional module. These outputs enable control of switching the public lighting circuits on and off through relays or contactors.</p>
  <p>More and more, there is a strong focus on optimizing energy consumption in towns and cities. One of the key areas to optimize and control is public lighting installations, which, through our IoT device CcMaster - Public Light Management, enable the optimization and control of public lighting panels. The competitive advantage lies in its easy installation, compact size, compatibility with third-party equipment (e.g., network analyzers), and adaptability to customer needs. Natively, it includes different control modes (scheduling, manual, astronomical clock) and supports remote management. This allows maintenance teams to have full supervision and control of all public lighting panels with easy access, avoiding unnecessary travel and reducing both response times to faults and incidents, while also dynamically adjusting switch-on and switch-off times.</p>
  <p>Our main clients are municipal and city councils, as well as regional administrations. For instance, we collaborate with Badajoz Provincial Council (Spain).</p>
  <p>Enerclic has patents for its measurement equipment the CcM2 and CcM4 devices, which are designed and manufactured by Enerclic also. These devices are integral to the Public Lighting solution, enabling highly precise measurement of energy flows.</p>
