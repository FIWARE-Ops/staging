  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Urbaser - SENSIoT (Big Data,Cloud Computing,Data Analytics,Internet of Things)</h1>
  <p>
   SENSIoT(Smart Environmental Services with IoT) is Urbaser’s IoT solution where a comprehensive set of information is automatically gathered from its assets and processed to maximize its value. The core of the technology is SENSIoT-Platform, which has been designed using Microsoft Azure services
  </p>
  <p><strong>Urbaser</strong> has developed its own Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructure known as SENSIoT (Smart Environmental Services with IoT) where a comprehensive set of information is automatically gathered from its assets and processed to maximize its value. The core of this IoT solution is Urbaser’s IoT platform, which has been designed using Microsoft Azure cloud services, by a combination of the latest technologies in terms of telecommunication standards, virtual machines, databases and control mechanisms.</p> <p>This platform has been built and scaled-up to be capable of ingesting a large amount of information gathered from all sort of Urbaser’s assets (vehicles, rubbish bins, industrial machines, electric meters, water meters, etc.) using electronic devices and sensors and later transmitted using several possible technologies (2G/3G/4G, MQTT, HTTPS, Sigfox, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, OPC, industrial protocols). After receiving the information, it is validated using different business rules, processed to transform it into other types of information, and finally stored so it is ready to be used by the different corporate tools.</p>
  
  <p>The main goal of SENSIoT platform is the reception of all information generated by Urbaser’s IoT devices installed in different machines and offer it to our company and our References/Customers in a safe and classified way. SENSIoT centralizes and processes the information coming from all types of assets such as vehicles, dumpsters/bins, water meters, and fixed machinery.</p> <p>Furthermore, SENSIoT allows integrating this information with other systems, such as smart city platforms.</p>
