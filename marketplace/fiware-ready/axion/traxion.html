  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Axion - Traxion (Data Analytics,Internet of Things,Software as a Service)</h1>
  <p>
   Traxión is an automatic system for inflow and level of occupancy control, based on non-intrusive feedback sensors via IP cameras with integrated video analytics
  </p>
  <p>Traxión controls entry and occupancy levels through non-intrusive sensors. It integrates with IP cameras with integrated video analysis and has an alarm system and generation of statistics on maximum, minimum, and average values ​​of the capacity in real-time. The alarms can interact with elements from other verticals such as lighting and sound, and even with the private emergency networks of the security forces.</p> <p>At the current moment generated by the Covid-19 crisis, the value that this Spanish platform can bring is high: its ability to contribute to monitoring people and movements is a key aspect of the measures to be adopted in the future  in the face of the progressive lack of understanding  the population and the organization and maintenance of social distance.</p> <ul> <li>Count: number of people crossing a virtual line defined in the system. </li> <li>Flow control: detection of a specific direction of movement and its speed, even in a crowd. </li> <li>Detection of safety distance (social distancing) </li> <li>Occupancy levels: detection of a level of agglomeration in a given area, both in open and closed areas. </li> <li>Thermal detection (fever for access) </li> <li>Identification of use of protection elements (masks) </li> <li>Real-time data: transmitted to the system's administration platform at the moment.</li> </ul> <p>Customizable presentation interface: Storage, processing, and presentation in customizable</p>
  <p>The possibility to connect Video Analytics and Edge computing of its data to the Fiware environment. Counting and people flow monitoring</p>
