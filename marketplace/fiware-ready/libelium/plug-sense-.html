  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Libelium - Plug&amp;Sense! (Internet of Things,Cloud Computing,Sensory Systems)</h1>
  <p>
   Plug&amp;Sense is an IoT Device that offers its users several benefits such as easily attachment of the Sensor probes, solar panel option battery recharge, the 4G module features a GPS receiver etc.
  </p>
  <p>Plug&amp;Sense! offers its users several benefits.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sensor probes can be attached easily by just screwing them into the bottom sockets. This allows you to add new sensing capabilities to existing networks in just minutes. In the same way, sensor probes may be easily replaced in order to ensure the lowest maintenance cost of the sensor network. Libelium offers different models for different vertical applications such as Smart Cities, Smart Agriculture, Industry 4.0, Asset tracking, etc, with more than 100 sensors in total.</p></li> <li><p>Battery can be recharged using the internal or external solar panel options (common USBrecharging is of course another option). The external solar panel is mounted on a 45ยบ holder which ensures the maximum performance of each outdoor installation. For the internal option, the solar panel is embedded on the front of the enclosure, perfect for use where space is a major challenge. The rechargeable battery has a load of 6600 mAh, which ensures non-stop working time during the weeks when the sunlight is lower.</p></li> <li><p>Waspmote Plug &amp; Sense! counts with holders specially designed for outdoor installations in streetlights and building fronts. Metal cable ties are provided to easily adjust the node to street light posts. Installation can be done in minutes as you only need to tie the cables on the enclosure holders and then to the post. Once the node is secured just press the on button and the node will start automatically to send the data gathered from the sensors to the Gateway.</p></li> <li><p>There are multiple radio options in order to communicate the sensor nodes with the Gateway. 802.15.4, 868, and 900 are used commonly to create local, start topologies. WiFi can be used to connect with any WiFi AP while the 4G radio can be used to send the sensor data directly to the Cloud without using an intermediate Gateway. Sigfox and LoRaWAN modules are special for IoT applications and get very long-range links.</p></li> <li><p>The 4G module features a GPS receiver which allows to easily perform real-time tracking applications.</p></li> <li><p>Plug &amp; Sense! units are able to connect with the most common industrial communication  protocols: RS-232, RS-485, Modbus, 4-20 mA (current loop) and CAN Bus. This feature opens a wide variety of applications for industrial sensing, and automation, military, automobile, vehicle tracking, or remote factory management.</p></li> <li><p>Lastly, Plug &amp; Sense! models with 4G radio have an External SIM socket which allows developers to easily add and change a carrier SIM card in order to connect the devices to any 4G / 3G / GPRS / GSM cellular network</p></li> </ul>
