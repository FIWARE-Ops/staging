  <p>Dragsa is an IoT platform that connects and digitizes assets, processes their information in real time, and transforms data into clear results to optimize production and the management of infrastructure and services. It integrates remote control, AI for smart management, and preventive maintenance systems. </p> <ul> <li>Comprehensive real-time monitoring and diagnostics </li> <li>Advanced analytics to anticipate and resolve issues </li> <li>Automation of tasks and critical tasks </li> <li>Remote technical support that reduces downtime</li> </ul>
  <p>The main challenge lies in demonstrating the ability of our technology to integrate with the FIWARE Context Broker, through the use of data models aligned with FIWARE standards and the implementation of NGSI operations (CRUD) that allow both sending context information and receiving and processing updates in real time. </p> <p>This will be used for real-time monitoring of a smart seaport and a parking and charging solution for personal mobility vehicles.</p>
