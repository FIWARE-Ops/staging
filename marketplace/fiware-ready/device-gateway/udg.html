  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Device Gateway - UDG (Internet of Things)</h1>
  <p>
   UDG provides a perfect solution for smart cities projects. It has been designed to handle large-scale deployments with heterogeneous IoT systems. By enabling different classes of IoT Devices, sensors, and actuators into a common data plane, UDG highly simplifies the management of such deployments.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Interoperability, legacy integration and increased reliability</p> <p>By enabling  wide interoperability with over 40 standards and communication protocols, UDG enables  smooth integration of legacy systems and transition towards new technologies. Cross systems integration and simplification</p> <p><strong>UDG</strong> enables the integration of heterogeneous systems and IoT technologies into a common data plane that enables it to bring together all sorts of data in real-time. It enables the development of cross-domain applications and  centralized control and monitoring of your deployed IoT systems. This leads to  simplified maintenance with substantial cost savings, and increased reliability.</p> <p><strong>Cost-saving</strong></p> <p>By giving access to a larger offer in terms of solutions and suppliers, UDG enables a more open competition with reduced cost and a richer offer in terms of functionalities. It also enables smart cities to adapt and reuse a large set of applications and solutions developed by other smart cities at a very low cost. UDG is a source of both capital and operating expenditure savings.</p> <p><strong>Increased reliability</strong></p> <p>By enabling extensive interoperability, UDG enables smart cities to avoid vendors lock-in. It increases  reliability by easing the adoption of alternative solutions and technology providers. It is more reliable and cost saving through competition.</p> <p><strong>Compliance with present and future solutions for smart cities</strong></p> <p><strong>UDG</strong> is a certified FIWARE solution, fully interoperable with OASC API, oneM2M, LWM2M, CoAP, MQTT, and other protocols. UDG Alliance is a partner of the European Large Scale Pilot on Internet of Things for Smart Cities (Synchronicity), where it will lead the development of the European marketplace for smart cities IoT solutions. It is also in the core group developing the Urban Platform of the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC). A guarantee that UDG technology will be compliant with emerging technologies, applications, and platforms for smart cities.</p> <p><strong>Real-Time Data Monitoring</strong></p> <p><strong>UDG</strong> enables smart cities to benefit from customized graphical user interfaces and applications with real time monitoring of their environment and better services for their citizens.</p> <p><strong>Data sharing and comparison</strong></p> <p>Thanks to  close integration with the mainstream European smart cities frameworks and platforms for IoT management, UDG eases  data sharing, data comparison, and benchmarking among cities.</p> <p><strong>Privacy by Design</strong></p> <p><strong>UDG</strong> has been designed to fully comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and benefits from several research projects in this domain. It is also working on close collaboration with top European experts to deliver fully privacy by design solutions</p>
