  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Telocate - FI-ASSIST (Internet of Things)</h1>
  <p>
   The FI-ASSIST project is a system developed by the German company Telocate to introduce a high-precision indoor navigation system and location infrastructure for restaurants based on acoustic localization.
  </p>
  <p>Location awareness has become a key factor to Smart Mobility in public space. Location-based services in fast food restaurants can offer new conveniences to the customer such as locating a person at a table and serving the order directly. However, today’s technical solutions lack precision and reliability.</p> <p>The <strong>FI-ASSIST</strong> project is a system developed by the German company Telocate to introduce a high-precision indoor navigation system and location infrastructure for restaurants based on acoustic localization. FI-ASSIST consists of an application for mobile phones, mobile acoustic senders, and  the Telocate acoustic receivers installed in the building. The localization system enables  finding the customer's position quickly and reliably, reducing the restaurant's staff overhead and workload.</p>
  <p>Those who roam on exhibition grounds or in department stores know how difficult it can be to find one’s way in large building complexes. The new indoor navigation solution Telocate ASSIST provides support for smartphone users with unprecedented accuracy.</p>
