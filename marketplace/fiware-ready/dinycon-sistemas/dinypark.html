  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Dinycon Sistemas - DinyPARK (Artificial Intelligence,Data Spaces,Internet of Things,Mobility and Location)</h1>
  <p>
   DinyPARK offers a complete smart parking solution for vehicle counting, tracking and classification with information on free spaces in parking lots. DinyPARK offers precise real-time information on the number of vehicles that are in a certain area, for both indoor and outdoor car parks.
  </p>
  <p><strong>DinyPARK</strong> offers several benefits that can significantly enhance the efficiency and convenience of urban parking. The main advantage is a reduction of the time drivers spend searching for available spots, thus reducing stress, alleviating road congestion, decreasing pollution and noise levels, etc. Here is a list of other advantages: </p> <ul> <li>Optimised parking space use: the deployment of sensors, guiding systems, and the software to process real-time data is what makes DinyPARK a solution to efficiently manage parking spaces.  </li> <li>Time and fuel savings: drivers spend less time circling to find parking, leading to reduced fuel consumption and lower carbon emissions. This also enhances overall traffic flow in urban areas. - -</li> <li>Improved user experience: DinyPARK provides real-time information about available spaces through Dinycon´s ATPOINTS Web App and street information displays (Signage). This improves the overall experience for drivers by reducing stress and frustration associated with parking. </li> <li>Enhanced revenue generation: by efficiently managing parking spaces, cities or parking operators can maximize revenue from parking facilities. This can be achieved through dynamic pricing based on demand or increased turnover of parking spaces. </li> <li>Data-driven insights: DinyPARK generates valuable data on parking patterns, peak hours, and usage trends. This data can be used to optimize city planning, traffic management, and future infrastructure development. </li> <li>Environmental impact: by reducing traffic congestion and emissions associated with parking searches, DinyPARK contributes to environmental sustainability. </li> <li>Integration with smart cities: smart parking is a key component of smart city initiatives, integrating with other urban systems like transportation, IoT networks, and data analytics platforms to create more efficient and sustainable urban environments. </li> <li>Accessibility and safety: real-time information on available parking spaces can also improve accessibility for drivers with disabilities (PRM). Additionally, it can contribute to safer parking environments by reducing the need for sudden maneuvers and illegal parking. </li> </ul> <p>Overall, DinyPARK can help modernise urban infrastructure and improve the quality of life for residents and visitors by making parking easier, more efficient, and environmentally friendly.</p>
  <p>The challenge of implementing smart parking solutions lies in trying to reduce the number of sensors and infrastructure required to monitor and control a parking lot. In some cases, car parks can have hundreds or even thousands of available slots, and there even be the need to differentiate between standard, PRM, or even EV recharging slots. In this sense, Dinycon´s differentiator is in combining multiple technologies (hybrid) to suit specific car park requirements. The accuracy and reliability of the sensors also have to be addressed, especially in challenging environments such as outdoor parking with varying weather conditions, parking spaces in open unmarked ground i.e. in fields, obstructions in the line of sight (especially for computer vision), and lack of lighting conditions to read number plates.  </p> <p>Additionally, privacy concerns may arise, necessitating the implementation of transparent data collection practices and compliance with regulations such as GDPR or similar data privacy laws. Furthermore, integrating smart parking technology with existing infrastructure and systems poses technical challenges that need to be addressed for seamless operation and effective utilization of data. Over the last five years, we have doubled down on efforts to bring artificial intelligence into the picture.  The aim is to use Deep Learning algorithms with processed images to discern between occupied/free car park slots with the absolute minimum number of sensors. The solution has been developed in conjunction with the R&amp;D technology Centre Tekniker.</p>
  <p>Since the year 2000, Dinycon has installed smart parking in more than 80 projects projects. To name a few are public car parks at the following Municipalities; Irún, Santander, Deba, Coruña, San Sebastián, Guadalajara, Getxo, Amorebieta, Alcalá de Henares, Salamanca, Utrera etc., as well as internationally in cities such as Teheran (Iran), Lima (Perú), Santiago de Chile and Quito (Ecuador). </p> <p>Likewise, Dinycon has been subcontracted in smart parking projects by clients such as Telefónica, T-Systems, and Cibernos to deploy in cities like Adeje, Málaga, Calviá, La Nucia, and Badajoz to name a few. </p> <p>All projects involved a combination of installing sensors, receiving the data from sensors in the DinyPARK software platform, and then presenting the occupancy level of each car park on street information displays distributed around the city.</p>
