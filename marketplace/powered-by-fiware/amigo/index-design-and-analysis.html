  <p>
   IDA integrates into one web platform climate modeling, ground-based and remotely sensed measures of weather variables to provide high-level software capabilities for customized climate risk assessment globally, including climate index computation, visualization, and reporting.
  </p>
  <p>With <strong>IDA</strong> we radically change the use of climate data and climate information in the climate risk management industry, since References/Customers will be able to perform tailored analysis for the index-based insurance industry, automatically getting maps and reports, effectively calculating premiums.</p> <p>Compared to existing solutions IDA is more performing and scalable, easier to use, cloud-based, cheaper and it offers over time continuity for monitoring indices, thus ensuring economic benefits to References/Customers.IDA allows References/Customers to enter a huge variety of data that could be customized according to usersâ€™ needs.</p>
  <p>A crucial problem affecting insurance and reinsurance companies in climate index-based risk transfer schemes is the lack of a trusted, transparent, independent and affordable way to design, compute and monitor the underpinning climate indices .</p> <p>AMIGO - as an innovative SME providing climate solutions to international organizations, insurers and reinsurers, for the management of climate-related risk in the agricultural sector - has developed a new generation of methods and tools for climate risk management.</p>
  <p>Insurance Companies, international organizations</p>
