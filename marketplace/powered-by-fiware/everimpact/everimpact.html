   Everimpact measures and monetizes Cities’ CO2 emissions by combining satellites and ground sensors’ data. Cities get a real-time map of their emissions at street and building level, at a precision never reached before.

  <p><strong>Everimpact</strong> measures and monetizes Cities’ CO2 emission by combining satellites and ground sensors’ data. Cities get a real-time map of their emissions at street and building levels, at a precision never reached before. This is helpful for Cities to see whether their climate actions are working, and help them target key areas of interventions.</p> <p>Monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions as part of their climate plan, means that Cities can now monetize their CO2 reductions with various green finance instruments. In a nutshell, Everimpact is an innovative concept because it helps Cities draw important revenues from monitoring their CO2 emissions.</p>
