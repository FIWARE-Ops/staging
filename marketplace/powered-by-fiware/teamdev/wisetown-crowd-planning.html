   WiseTown Crowd Planning is the platform that allows Public Administration to activate communication with citizens regarding planning objectives, with the ultimate goal of generating active involvement. A tool developed for a participatory urban planning.
  </p>
  <p><strong>WiseTown Crowd Planning</strong> is the platform that allows the Public Administration to activate communication with citizens regarding planning objectives, with the aim of generating active involvement.</p> <p>The tool allows to publish, in specific thematic areas, urban development plans accompanied by illustrative cartographic data, information sheets and multimedia content. Citizens will be able to use the platform to interact with the Public Administration by proposing their own views on the proposal and animating a real participatory planning process. Administrative action is considerably more effective if it is shared. The implementation of territorial improvement policies must be accompanied by a process of gathering needs and sharing strategies so that all citizens feel like protagonists of the city in which they live.</p>
  <p>Collaboration between citizens and government institutions begins with the adoption of a platform that encourages social initiative and participation by the population. Local governments benefit greatly as they welcome citizen input and increase trust in administrative action.</p>
