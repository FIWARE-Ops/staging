  <p>
   WiseTown Situation Room is a platform for the management of events and emergencies in an urban context. The tool collects the data produced by the city and displays it through a dashboard that ensures immediate analysis and response.
  </p>
  <p><strong>WiseTown Situation Room</strong> responds to the need for administrations to monitor city events, mobility flows and emergency situations in real-time, with the aim of safely managing urban dynamics. The basis of the WiseTown platform is the huge amount of data produced by the monitored phenomena. </p> <p>The data collected comes from various sources: video surveillance systems, dedicated apps, IoT sensor data, video cameras, the web, geo-referenced social data and more. The control room collects and aggregates the “situation” data and uses them as tools to make and implement operational decisions in a short time.</p> <p>The data is then displayed in a single dashboard in which the central element is the map of the area, complemented by information boxes, media streams and customized statistics. The dashboard provides a visualization of the data that ensures immediate analysis and response.</p>
  <p>The control of an event or an emergency situation in a city requires a great deal of energy and resources for a public administration. It requires a large amount of field staff, adequate tools, and a budget; a control room for Smart City allows an effective and sustainable remote monitoring.</p>
