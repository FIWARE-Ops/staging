   WiseTown is a digital system for the city fully scalable, modular, designed to allow full integration with the city administration’s existing systems, third party solutions, IoT applications and external data sources. WiseTown is the engine that collects the city’s data and makes it available.
  </p>
  <p><strong>WiseTown</strong> is a middleware solution that processes and analyzes a large amount of data, giving then back to the operators only the information useful to solve a specific issue, in order to avoid time, money, and waste of resources. It is an infrastructure that is highly modular, interoperable, cloud open-source, that uses the most advanced FIWARE technologies, with the aim of facilitating the transition of cities into smart cities, so that they can adhere to the most innovative European standards, other than increasing their safety, inclusivity, sustainability.</p> <p>The smart city tools provided by WiseTown are customizable modules that make up the platform:</p> <ul> <li>WiseTown Geoanalytics: a Decision Support System available to city administrators and public administration professionals. Maps, graphs, infographics, and statistics highlight valuable information and provide an extrapolation of complex information useful for more informed urban planning.</li> <li>WiseTown Issue Manager: a digital system that enables citizens to support the city government by reporting city issues; at the same time it simplifies the internal workflow of the public administration by automating processes and improving the work of the operators.</li> <li>WiseTown Open Data Manager: searches and aggregates data on customizable criteria to produce Open Data catalogs for the Smart City. WiseTown software makes Public Administration data a common good, anonymous, and GDPR compliant.</li> <li>WiseTown Situation Room: a platform for the management of events and emergencies in an urban context. The tool collects the data produced by the city and displays it through a dashboard that ensures immediate analysis and response.</li> <li>WiseTown Crowd Planning: the platform that allows Public Administration to activate communication with citizens regarding planning objectives, with the ultimate goal of generating active involvement. A tool developed for participatory urban planning.</li> <li>WiseTown Thematic Dashboard: an application that allows you to create custom visualizations to compare map information with statistical data and real-time data from satellite systems. The dashboards can manage economic, demographic, social, environmental, and many other data.</li> </ul>
  <p>Every municipality is usually already equipped with a wide range of devices and sensors, but the results of all these technologies are almost wasted so far, as they become a huge amount of unrelated data, too complicated to process, which turns out to be a significant waste of time, money, and resources.</p> <p>Therefore, what they require is a technological system that guarantees an efficient collection and management of city data, with the integration of IoT services and technologies, a decision support system, and other tools to promote the active participation of citizens. Most importantly, the goal is to have a digital infrastructure capable of integrating the technologies already implemented in the municipality, making them more efficient and useful for all the stakeholders involved in the public sector (professionals, workers, and citizens).</p>
