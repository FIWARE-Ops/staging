   WiseTown Thematic Dashboard is an application that allows you to create custom visualizations to compare map information with statistical data and real-time data from satellite systems. The dashboards can manage economic, demographic, social, environmental and many other data.
  </p>
  <p><strong>WiseTown Thematic Dashboard</strong> is an application that creates customized views to compare cartographic information with statistical data and real-time data from satellite systems. All dashboards offer the highest degree of configurability and allow effective analysis of urban phenomena. </p> <p>Among the many possibilities, there are time-lapse satellite dashboards for comparing the evolution of the phenomenon over time; dashboards for analyzing public parks and gardens for reports on health of plants and vegetation; dashboards on the degree of urban land consumption; dashboards with social and economic data on the population; dashboards on quality of life indicators; dashboards on the analysis of mobility flows; dashboards for monitoring the safety of the city and the territory.</p> <p>Our interactive dashboards are map-based and contain statistical data analysis boxes with the ability to activate filters and selections to differentiate the display of information.</p>
  <p>Awareness of the city's needs starts with a correct understanding of what is happening. Visualizing data on a map, facilitated by selected graphs and statistics, is essential to get inside the complexity of reality.</p>
