   Smart Helios: A smart city software platform centralizing city management across multiple systems. It enables citizens, city operators, and decision-makers to consume and generate information, which the platform enriches with analytical functionalities.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Smart Helios</strong> is a comprehensive, modular, and interoperable smart city platform that centralizes city operations and provides a unified, data-driven view for decision-making. Using a FIWARE Context Broker as its core, the platform integrates various city systems and dimensions, transforming raw data into actionable insights through Smart Data Models, IoT agents, and advanced Machine Learning models. With an intuitive control panel, Smart Helios facilitates real-time management, predictive analysis, and big data capabilities, enhancing both operational efficiency and quality of life for citizens. Key benefits include reduced response times to incidents, optimized resource management, and minimized environmental impact.</p>
  <p>Cities today require dynamic, real-time data integration to address rapid urban growth and evolving citizen needs. <strong>Smart Helios</strong> addresses this by linking disparate city systems—traffic, waste, energy, and beyond—into one cohesive platform.  Designed for large-scale data ingestion and analysis, Smart Helios provides a foundation for projects in Smart Cities and Industrial IoT, supporting both private and public entities in driving consistent, sustainable urban policy.</p>
  <p>Smart Helios has been successfully implemented in cities across Spain (Almería) and Colombia (Manizales, Bogotá, and Sabaneta), supporting mobility and operational needs through partnerships with local authorities. Visit SKG Tecnología for additional project details and customer references.</p>
  <p>Smart Helios and SKG Tecnología have been recognized with multiple awards for innovation and excellence in smart city development, underscoring its impact and leadership in urban technological transformation.</p>
