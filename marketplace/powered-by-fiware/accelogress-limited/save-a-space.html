  <p>
   This cloud-based solution intelligently monitors and automates management of EV chargers and parking spaces on a per space / per user basis improving utilisation. 

End-users reserve their space in advance via an easy-to-use app with integrated payments, significantly reducing parking hassle.
  </p>
  <p>At Accelogress Limited we help parking managers to increase revenue across car parks by optimising occupancy with our Save-a-Space cloud parking management platform. We help them in three ways:</p> <ul> <li>1) We allow them to offer pre-bookable spaces, which improves how References/Customers can discover spaces, directing them to spaces they didn’t even know existed, taking away guesswork and helping them plan their trips better. </li> <li>2) Our platform integrates with the customer workflows of destinations, for example at train stations helping them to book parking as part of their train journey, venues or shops, so more spaces are sold directly where and when it matters.</li> <li>3) Parking managers register their spaces directly on our platform and just pop up appropriate signage at their car parks and they are ready to go.</li> </ul> <p>And our platform can do much more. We can integrate with real-time space occupancy sensing hardware, such as Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), helping to monitor and manage parking spaces via the Save-a-Space dashboard. Save-a-Space smartly computes optimal parking options for drivers on route to destinations based on personal pReference Material, providing real-time availability and a pre-booking facility within the Save-a-Space end user app.  Parking managers can gain insights through big data analysis with the opportunity to influence driver behaviour with time and location-specific offers and incentives, encouraging engagement with visitors and town centre retailers and businesses.</p>
  
  <p>Save-a-Space has been successfully trialed in the UK with city centre parking providers and will shortly begin a commercial trial with a large regional UK transport authority</p>
