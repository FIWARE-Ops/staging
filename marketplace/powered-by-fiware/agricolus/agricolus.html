  <p>
   Agricolus is a cloud platform created to simplify and enhance the work in the field of farmers and professionals. It is composed of the main applications of precision agriculture:  from satellite imagery with vegetation indices to forecast models for irrigation, fertilization, pest and diseases.
  </p>
  <p><strong>AGRICOLUS</strong>  is a cloud applications ecosystem for precision farming with multiple purposes: disease awareness and forecasts, crop monitoring, decision support system for treatments and fertilizers, farm management, and end-to-end traceability bringing valuable information to final users. It is on the market and multinational agroholding companies, medium-big farms, the association of farmers and the government are using it successfully.  AGRICOLUS is FIWARE IoT Ready certified. AgriPlug is our OBD device that supports the integration of the ecosystem with ISOBUS enabled machines to exchange logs and send information for precision treatments and operations on crops.  AgriTrack traceability system provides documentary evidence about the origin and history of agricultural products and food, to demonstrate products’ safety and the commitment to the quality of the producer. To ensure this we propose a new approach: traceability needs to start from the field, and collected data must be blockchain secured.</p>
  <p>Today farmers face several challenges, we are mostly working on:</p> <p>International market competition with products coming from unruled countries that produce at a very low cost. The effect is a reduction of the profit due to the need of reducing final selling prices. For this reason, farmers have to reduce costs and increase quality at the same time. Climate change requires continuous adaptation of the best time to proceed with any agricultural operation (seeding, fertilizing, manuring, irrigating, harvesting). Farmers need real-time support to understand the right timing for these operations.</p> <p>Agritech adoption among EU farmers is far below 20%, Agricolus can support them by making these technologies accessible and useful for daily work on the fields.</p>
  <p>Agricolus is addressing the precision software market that is estimated 1.1 Bln $ by 2022 (Markets and Markets), food traceability is even bigger and is estimated 14 Bln $  Agro holding companies that want to standardize with Agricolus good practices among their suppliers (farmers). Association of farmers that want to support their associates with better tools providing high-value technologies. Medium big farms that can reduce costs and have better control, and an end-to-end traceability of the production. Government in the agricultural department that uses our product to raise farmers awareness on diseases and other agricultural threats.</p>
