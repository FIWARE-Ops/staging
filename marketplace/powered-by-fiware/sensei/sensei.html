  <p>
   AI powered real-time video recognition solution for retail providing accurate in-store traffic flow analysis, sales performance, and product recognition.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Sensei</strong> is an AI-powered, real-time video recognition solution that helps retailers understand the in-store activity. Sensei leverages streams from existing store cameras to provide analysis on traffic, customer flow, and product interaction as well as to detect empty shelves.</p> <p>At Sensei we developed algorithms that turn any installed camera into a powerful sensor, which allows it to digitize  brick and mortar stores, digitize its products (SKUs) and measure real-time customer experience. Sensei provides retailers with accurate in-store analytics and insights ranging from traffic flow, store benchmarking, products’ performance, out-of-shelf detection and allows for optimized operations and drive more sales.</p>
  <p>Despite e-commerce growth, brick and mortar stores still generate 89% of the total volume of sales in Europe. Furthermore, sales conversion is on average 20% for fashion stores, and on-shelf availability of products in supermarkets can be as low as 85%. Both these issues represent lost sales opportunities leading to an overall of 3.3 trillion dollars lost annually due to these inefficiencies.</p> <p>To date, unlike online stores, there is no systematic way of tracking which products elicit interest from References/Customers but are not converted (lost sales) and to automatically digitize a store space, and its products. The current state-of-the-art technologies for tracking can only determine (inaccurately) how many people enter and leave the store and do not provide any information of the client's engagement in store, which creates a significant blind spot leading to over/understaffing stores, stocking the wrong inventory and missing sales opportunities.</p>
