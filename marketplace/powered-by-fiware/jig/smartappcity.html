  <p>
   SmartAppCity brings together all the city services and information in one single app.
  </p>
  <p><strong>SmartAppCity</strong> brings together all the city services and information. Some examples of the data provided by the app are: arrival information on public transportation, traffic cameras, alerts, municipal news and events, open pharmacies, gas stations prices, tourist information and routes, city street guide, shopping, weather forecast, radars, public Wi-Fi zones, parks, free parking spots, environmental parameters…</p> <p>The app is addressed to the citizens and tourists of a city. Under a public-private partnership (PPP) framework, the municipality shows its open data to serve the citizens, and the city shops and businesses offer their products and services.</p> <p>The app is based on a technological and competitive differentiation about what exists for the problem solution, as well as it has a great market potential for making relevant use of cloud technologies and the existing open data of the city.</p>
  <p>Nowadays there are many companies in the world creating mobile applications, some of them also implement applications targeted to citizens offering some type of data related to their city.  There is no App that covers all the services and all the information provided by the local government to citizens, and that also integrates geolocation of local shops and businesses and, with all the information generated by the user, provide intelligence to the system on behalf of the public administrations, local businesses and even the own citizen that increase the quality of services they receive.</p>
  <p>The SmartAppCity project covers the three pillars supporting a smart city: public administration, citizens and local business:</p> <p>The local administration knows the impressions of citizens and the impact of their decisions by  analyzing the provided social information , and by opening a new communication channel. The city shops and businesses use this technology as a geo-marketing tool to open a specific communication channel with References/Customers or prospective References/Customers. The citizens  use a channel to provide updated information about life in the city sharing information about their culture, habits or infrastructures and road conditions.</p>
