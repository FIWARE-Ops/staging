   The main objective of Waste4Think is to move forward the current waste management practices into a circular economy motto demonstrating the value of integrating and validating 20 eco-innovative solutions that cover all the waste value chain.
  </p>
  <p>The main objective of Waste4Think is to move forward the current waste management practices into a circular economy motto demonstrating the value of integrating and validating 20 eco-innovative solutions that cover all the waste value chain. The benefits of these solutions will be enhanced by a holistic waste data management methodology and will be demonstrated in 4 complementary urban areas in Europe.  Attached to this main objective a set of specific ones have been defined to indicate what the project will be focused into:</p> <ul> <li>To reduce generation of waste thanks to prevention campaigns and cooperative activities to promote reuse and eco-design solutions.</li> <li>To promote behavioural changes in the waste generators by awareness campaigns and new educational tools in order to foster more sustainable consumption and production habits and to increase the rate of waste sorting. </li> <li>To improve the integral waste management services reducing their management costs and the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. </li> <li>To reduce the amount of primary waste deposited in landfill to zero and to the maximum in case of secondary waste.</li> <li>To identify the waste products with a low potential for recycling and to propose eco-innovative valorisation and production solutions.</li> <li>To assess the transferability to the market of the new proposed eco-innovative solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Expected impacts Integrating all these solutions we will be able to construct a virtual smart city laying the foundations of the circular economy maximizing the expected results up to:</p> <ul> <li>A 8% reduction of waste generation </li> <li>A 10% reduction of GHG emissions </li> <li>20% increment of waste sorting </li> <li>10% savings in the management costs</li> </ul>
  <p>The European WASTE4Think project, led by the DeustoTech institute of technology at the University of Deusto, seeks to design solutions based on the use of information and communication technologies that would enable the improvement of all waste management stages, adopting a global approach and particularly focusing on citizen participation in order to build more sustainable, eco-friendly cities.</p>
  <p>These will depend on the eco-solution: We have some eco-solutions whose potential References/Customers would be Public Administration or Waste Collection Companies (Collection Module, Planning Module and Treatment Plants).  Other eco-solutions are targeted to schools and universities (Learning Materials and Serious Games). Environmental consultancies and researchers also have some eco-solutions (Circular Economy Module) and finally: Citizens (Apps).</p>
