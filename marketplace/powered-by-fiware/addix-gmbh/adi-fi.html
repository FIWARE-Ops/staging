  <p><strong>ADDIX</strong> operates IT platforms based on FIWARE technology and open-source software. These highly capable, customizable Kubernetes-cluster are already in use by regional development organisations and utility companies.</p> <p>Data, for example regarding weather, traffic, parking or public transport, can be gathered, saved and accessed in compliance with the NGSI (V2 &amp; LD) standard.</p> <p>Exchanging data is possible via a multitude of existing connectors. Building individual connectors on customer requirements is also quickly possible.</p>
  <p><strong>ADDIX</strong> operates its own infrastructure in the field of radio link systems, fiber, IoT and WLAN. </p> <p>The #SH_WLAN with &gt; 4.000 access points and 1.3 million users is one of the largest free and public WLAN networks in Germany. Our own fiber network brings high-speed internet to our customers. Remote areas are connected with powerful radio link systems. Over 1.000 customers use our Astimax VoIP solution. A variety of cloud services are provided in ADDIXâ€˜s own data center.</p> <p>Building &amp; operating the ADI-FI Platform is based on our experience in many fields we work in for over 20 years now regarding a smart region and a smart city.</p>
