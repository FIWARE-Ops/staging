  <p>
   AguaLink enables FIWARE integration of water reservoir monitoring data, including water level, flow, pressure, conductivity, energy use, and more. Real-time sensor values are pushed directly using the IoTA-JSON protocol.
  </p>
  <p>Agualytics DataBridge is a ready-to-integrate solution that allows clients to receive real-time data from water reservoirs directly into their FIWARE architecture. Designed for smart irrigation and water infrastructure monitoring, it supports seamless data delivery using the IoTA-JSON protocol.</p> <p>Clients only need to configure their FIWARE IoT Agent once and share their access details. Agualytics takes care of pushing the sensor data (water level, pressure, flow, conductivity, energy consumption, and more), ensuring fast and reliable integration with NGSI-compliant systems.</p> <p>About benefits:</p> <p>Easy and fast integration with existing FIWARE platforms</p> <p>Real-time monitoring of key water reservoir parameters</p> <p>No need to develop custom connectors or API scrapers</p> <p>Improves data interoperability and smart water management</p> <p>Compatible with NGSI v2 and standard FIWARE components</p>
  <p>Efficient water management is increasingly critical due to climate variability, resource scarcity, and growing demands from agriculture and industry. Monitoring key indicators such as water levels, pressure, energy consumption, and flow in reservoirs is essential for operational efficiency and sustainability.</p> <p>Many organizations lack the tools or capacity to collect and integrate this data in real time. Agualytics addresses this gap by offering a solution that bridges physical sensor data from irrigation reservoirs directly into FIWARE platforms, without requiring complex middleware or manual data handling.</p> <p>By automating this data flow, Agualytics enables smarter decision-making and supports the digital transformation of water-related infrastructures.</p>
