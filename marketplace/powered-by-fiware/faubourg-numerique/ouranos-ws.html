  <p>
   ouranos-ws is an easy-to-use solution to enable the NGSI-LD superpowers, with the strategic goal to manage your virtualized assets as digital twins. It allows you to DESIGN your specific data models, NAVIGATE through your graphs of entities and CONTROL the interactions with the other systems.
  </p>
  <p><strong>ouranos-ws</strong>is an easy-to-use solution to enable the NGSI-LD super-powers, with the strategic goal to manage your virtualized assets as digital twins. This platform has been developed and used for many years by our FIWARE iHub Faubourg Numérique with mainly 3 groups of features that can be used through incremental management cycles: </p> <ul> <li><strong>DESIGN</strong> your specific data models, possibly by reusing the existing ones, especially the ones from the Smart Data Models initiative </li> <li><strong>NAVIGATE</strong> through your graphs of entities and relationships and to create and update the related objects </li> <li><strong>CONTROL</strong> the interactions with the other systems, including the security layers, the subscription and registration mechanisms</li> </ul>
  <p>Whatever is your level of maturity about NGSI-LD usage it can be hard to deal with it only through APIs: </p> <ul> <li>if you don't know about NGSI-LD but are eager to experiment and build your first use cases </li> <li>or if you are managing complex NGSI-LD environments involving a wide variety of stakeholders ouranos-ws offers you an intuitive user interface to manage your NGSI-LD graphs of entities and relationships. It allows you and your team to better organize the data models and to continuously improve the smart solutions you build upon the NGSI-LD API</li> </ul>
