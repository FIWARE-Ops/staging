  <p>
   SmartTown is a horizontal platform, which includes different verticals that can occur in a population, for its remote management in a centralized way and offers interoperability between the different devices and integrations
  </p>
  <p><strong>SmartTown</strong> is a horizontal platform, which includes different verticals that can occur in a population, for its remote management in a centralized way and offers interoperability between the different devices and integrations. This allows that, regardless of the nature of the devices, they can communicate with each other by configuring a series of rules. In addition, the platform helps save money and contributes to improving the environment, thanks to the data obtained from the different devices located in the municipality.</p>
  <p>The main objective of <strong>SmartTown</strong> is to centralize the remote management of all verticals of the population and make them interoperable with each other. In addition, to help save energy and improve the quality of citizens' life.</p>
  <p>SmartTown is focused on marketing itself, above all, to small municipalities.  Some of our clients are, for example, the Provincial Council of Ciudad Real, Puebla del Principe, Carri√≥n, Argamasilla de Alba, El Robledo, etc.</p>
