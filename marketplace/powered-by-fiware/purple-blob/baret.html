  <p>The FIWARE enabled platform <strong>BARET</strong> provides a way for a Smart Destination to gather and analyze data to promote policies and a proper governance model around the Smart Destination. To achieve this goal, the platform gathers data from social media, a wide variety of news posted on web pages, press releases, and region's marketing campaigns and cross-matches them with regional sensor data models, hotel occupation data, and sentiment analysis to determine the best local government governance policies and predict the best areas to ensure the success of the marketing campaigns in the region while allowing the local government to establish workgroups with the touristic agents of the territory around the gathered data to adapt their value proposals accordingly.</p> <p>FIWARE architecture provides the perfect developing environment for the tourism sector, gathering data from a variety of protocols such as LoRaWAN, REST calls, NB-IoT devices in one platform, cross-matching objective data such as the temperature, air quality parameters, and occupation with semantic data obtained from different social networks and review sites. This flexible architecture makes for the perfect foundation for a Smart Destination ecosystem.</p> <p>BARET has the ability to learn by analyzing this information and helps design successful strategies and actions for destinations. It allows destinations and companies in the tourism sector to have control of the main data flows that are of interest to design their strategies for the future and measure the real impact of their actions:</p> <ul> <li>The platform measures the flows and volumes of people who use the routes or visit facilities in real time and compares them with the impact of the marketing campaigns and actions aimed at strengthening the destination brand.</li> <li>Analyzes the topics that References/Customers and potential users are talking about in real time to design content marketing strategies according to the reality and interests of the target audience.</li> <li>Compare trends with the real evolution of reserves and business volume, revealing the target market and its alignment.</li> <li>Real impact analysis of investments and sponsorships, obtaining intelligent recommendations for the future and conclusions on their performance and efficiency.</li> </ul>
