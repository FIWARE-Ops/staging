  <p>
   Agrigateway is a suite of open-source cloud applications based on FIWARE agrifood technologies. Designed for farmers, agronomists and agricultural consortia, it ensures interoperability between a wide range of agritech hardware solutions, available on the market and provided by different vendors.
  </p>
  <p>Using FIWARE Context Broker, Agrigateway is a rich suite of complementary open-source FIWARE Generic Enablers. It is made up of two modules: the first is Agri Weather Gateway, a module designed to integrate weather stations from a wide variety of meteo stations. It allows aggregation and visualization of weather data for farmers and cooperatives that need more in-depth analysis. The second is Agri Contractor Gateways, a module that enables the collection and display of data from agricultural machinery via CANBUS and ISOBUS technology.</p> <p>Through Agrigateways we support farmers, agronomists and agricultural consortia in several ways:</p> <ul> <li><p>Provide producers with a standardized interface that can be used by AG platforms and other AG-related products.</p></li> <li><p>Provide a stand-alone platform that helps to visualize data from different sensors/machinery.</p></li> <li><p>Provide a product that can be used by governments (local and central) and contractors to connect many different sensors/machinery and to provide access to farmers.</p></li> <li><p>Provide a product that can operate independently or can be interconnected with other platforms.</p></li> </ul>
  <p>This product has some major interests:</p> <ul> <li><p>Providing a standardized interface to several producers that can be used by AG platforms and other AG-related products</p></li> <li><p>Providing a standalone platform that can be used to visualize data coming from different sensors</p></li> <li><p>Providing a product that can be used even by the government (local and central) to connect many different sensors and to provide access to the farmers</p></li> </ul> <p>The developed product aims to fill a gap in the market. This kind of product is more than welcomed by the Public Administration and by platform producers to simplify access to this kind of data.</p> <p>This idea starts from a common need expressed by two of these platforms, Agricolus and 365FarmNet, that meet in the IOF2020 ecosystem and are recognized as a common benefit to run a joint effort to build this GE. Both companies recognized FIWARE as the natural architecture to choose for this kind of development.</p>
  <p>Agrigateways is designed for farmers, agronomists and agricultural consortia and government departments.</p>
