  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: Libelium - Iris360 Platform (Artificial Intelligence,Data Spaces,Digital Twins,Interaction Technologies,Internet of Things)</h1>
  <p>
   Iris360 is an Urban Management Platform integrating Device Management, Data Spaces, Urban Digital Twins, LDTs, and AI Management through a Semantic Broker powered by FIWARE with NGSI-LD and Smart Data Models enabling cities to connect data, simulate scenarios, and make evidence-based decisions.
  </p>
  <p>Iris360 is Libelium’s flagship Urban Management Platform, born from the integration of HOPU’s expertise in environmental monitoring and Libelium’s IoT and data-driven solutions. It combines Data Spaces, Local Digital Twins, AI Management, and a Semantic Broker to deliver actionable intelligence. Benefits include improved decision-making, transparency, citizen engagement, and evidence-based policies for sustainable, resilient cities. It has been built over 70 cities' experiences available in https://fiware.hopu.eu/directorio/#/</p>
  <p>Cities face increasing pressure to reduce emissions, manage mobility, and ensure livability while meeting the EU Green Deal and Mission Cities targets. Fragmented data and siloed systems hinder efficiency. Iris360 addresses these challenges by providing an interoperable, scalable platform aligned with EU standards (FIWARE, GAIA-X, MIMs) to break silos and enable holistic urban governance.</p>
  <p>Iris360 builds on deployments across 50+ cities, including Madrid, Valencia, Cartagena, Logroño, Murcia, Helsinki, Tampere, and NEOM (Saudi Arabia). Customers span municipalities, regions, and global initiatives with UNDP, UNECE, and ITU-T. Flagship use-cases include Urban Heat Islands, Air Quality &amp; Health Impact Models, Low Emission Zones, and Smart Mobility Digital Twins. <a href="https://fiware.hopu.eu/directorio/#/">Directories</a></p>
