  <p>
   Breeze Technologies enables cities and corporates to create a more liveable environment by providing actionable insights based on environmental sensor data.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Breeze Technologies</strong> provides an environmental intelligence platform: It delivers hyperlocal comprehensive and accurate air quality data from public and private data sources and low-cost sensors, as well as insights based on recent scientific and medical studies and actionable recommendations from a growing, self-learning catalog of more than 3.500 interventions.</p> <p>Breeze's air quality sensors are up to 50.000 times smaller and up to 1.000 times cheaper than traditional measurement devices. Breeze offers a simple and easy-to-use UI.  For businesses, we explain the effects of the current air quality situation, predict possible improvements using different tools and methods and also provide a marketplace with vendors offering air quality improvement solutions.  For cities, Breeze gives the planning and environmental departments access to holistic and high-resolution live data. Breeze also offers a standardized API and is integrable with standard industry solutions like building management systems and business intelligence software.</p>
  <p>Air pollution is the  biggest environmental health threat of our time, killing 7 million people and costing the world economy 5 trillion USD per year. Data-driven decision making remains unfeasible as sensing equipment is expensive, stakeholders lack the necessary knowledge to analyze the data and suitable interventions are unknown.</p>
