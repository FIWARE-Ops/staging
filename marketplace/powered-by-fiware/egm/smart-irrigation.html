  <p><strong>ASSESSMENT</strong> Water consumption can be considerably reduced by dosing it according to the real water needs of the grass. It allows eliminating a recurrent tendency to over-water the ground.</p> <p><strong>SOLUTIONS</strong> </p> <p>The solution includes: </p> <ul> <li>humidity sensors set up on the ground </li> <li>the interoperable context broker Stellio in order to contextualize data and propose an automatized watering schedule</li> </ul> <p><strong>ROI</strong></p> <ul> <li>up to 30% of water consumption savings </li> <li>operations associated with the maintenance (watering, mowing, use of fertilizers, mechanical operations) can be greatly simplified and reduced to the strict minimum thanks to an autonomous and remote control system of various equipment (mower, sprinklers) </li> <li>obtaining a better quality ground allowing to reduce interventions on-site (fertilization, mechanical operations)</li> </ul>
  <p>The management of watering by municipalities is a subject where significant savings can be made quickly in terms of both finances and natural resources. Up to a 30% reduction in water consumption can be achieved.</p>
