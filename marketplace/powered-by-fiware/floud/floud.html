  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: Floud - Floud (Internet of Things,Data Analytics)</h1>
  <p>
   FLOUD is an innovative, flexible, and low-cost platform which offers the collection and analysis of things that flow (e.g., bicycles, vehicles, people).
  </p>
  <p>Based on sensors equipped with advanced video analysis software, FLOUD is the answer to our smart citiesâ€™ need for minimally invasive systems to improve transport management. The first key market application of the FLOUD system is flow-data provision for urban planning and operation. </p> <p>This refers to public authorities, particularly small and medium-sized cities, who require data for their transport/mobility management measures. It also refers to professionals (e.g. consultants, developers) that require data for their work and to companies investing in smart city products.</p>
  <p>The recent push towards Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) within modern-day smart cities requires a large amount of high-quality data in real-time. These include traffic, bicycles, and people flow. The latter two are of particular importance to promote eco-friendly mobility plans and support the shift towards sustainable behaviors. </p> <p>However, there is a significant industrial and economic problem related to traffic monitoring. While high-tech monitoring technologies, based on inductive loops, cameras, ultrasound, radio waves, to cite but a few, have existed for some time, public and private organizations continue to rely largely on manual counts or other limited forms of data collection.</p>
