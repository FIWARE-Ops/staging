   Bettair® is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that offers, for the first time high-quality large-scale pollution mapping tools (that use an advanced post-processing algorithm) for big cities.
  </p>
  <p>Bettair – high-quality large scale pollution mapping tools for big cities.</p> <p>Description &amp; Benefit <strong>Bettair®</strong> is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that permits, for the first time, to map urban air pollution in cities on a previously unimaginable scale based on a large deployment of outstandingly accurate gas sensors by using an advanced post-processing algorithm. A proprietary calibration process combined with the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to take into account both the known and unknown factors that affect the sensors allows Bettair® to increase the accuracy of the measurement up to 90% and more depending on the pollutant.</p> <p>Bettair Static Node. The Bettair Static Nodes are standalone sensor packs. The nodes do not require any external power supply and transmit data directly to a server for cloud processing. The specifications of the node are as follows:</p> <p>The static nodes are composed of electrochemical gas sensors (up to 4) to measure (ppb or ug/m3):   </p> <ul> <li>NO2 </li> <li>NO </li> <li>CO or H2S </li> <li>O3 or SO2</li> </ul> <p>Optical Particle Counter (ug/m3) for: </p> <ul> <li>PM1 </li> <li>PM2.5 </li> <li>PM10</li> </ul> <p>Other ambient quality indicators are also measured such as:</p> <ul> <li>Temperature (ºC) </li> <li>Relative humidity (%RH) </li> <li>Atmospheric pressure (hPa) </li> <li>Ambient noise (dbA)</li> </ul> <p>Features:</p> <ul> <li>Dust tight and water resistant (IP65 rated) </li> <li>Extended battery life (over 1 year of operation) </li> <li>Fully customized design </li> <li>Low-power electronics </li> <li>Wireless</li> </ul>
  <p>Our solution helps to mitigate air pollution by providing the cities with the insights of real- time pollution data.</p>
  <p>Smart cities, environmental Institutions.</p>
