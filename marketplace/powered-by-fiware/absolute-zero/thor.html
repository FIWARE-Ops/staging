  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: Absolute Zero - Thor (Internet of Things,Data Analytics,Sensory Systems)</h1>
  <p>
   Thor is the most versatile professional 360° with cloud-based workflow. Multiple AZ’s VR cameras individually record 12 video streams, and collect positioning metadata via in-built GPS sensor.
  </p>
  <p>AZ’s VR camera and cloud platform are currently introduced to the EU market. Interactive AR 360° streaming (currently at TRL 6) is achieved through:</p> <ul> <li><p>Multiple AZ’s VR cameras individually record 12 video streams and collect positioning metadata via an in-built GPS sensor. The metadata enables the cameras to become aware of their locations in step F). </p></li> <li><p>Each camera sends all 12 streams( including metadata) to the Cloud for further processing. </p></li> <li><p>Optical flow algorithms stitch all 12 streams into a 360° format for each camera; </p></li> <li><p>The resulting 360° videos are stored conjointly in a content delivery network container, which has a universal timeline that  synchronizes all videos to run simultaneously when viewing. </p></li> <li><p>A 360° media player interfaces to this container and allows to view the 360° video; </p></li> <li><p>A real-time AR layer, embedded in the 360° media player, visualizes all metadata and shows the other cameras as position markers. Each marker can be activated via an eye gaze trigger.1. - </p></li> </ul> <p>Interactive VR streaming is a novel technology with massive potential, enabling new possibilities for audiences who are not able to be at a location physically. AZ technology enables twofold unique benefits:</p> <p><strong>Production</strong> Event broadcasters can stream with multiple AZ cameras simultaneously. Our self-aware VR cameras are key to enabling a maximum level of automation, and hence facilitate easy adoption through first moving TV studios, event broadcasters, and video producers.</p> <p><strong>Consumption</strong> Audiences can revisit respective events in real-time, and jump between each of AZ’s camera’s locations at will. The cloud architecture furthermore creates a P2P ecosystem to host and distribute content directly to the end-user seamlessly. Consumers can view AR- enabled VR streams from any device, without the need for installation of additional software.</p>
  <p>On the huge field, one camera, even a 360° one is usually not enough. It is quite problematic both to switch between multiple streaming windows (especially with the hmd on) and to upload multiple streams with different metadata.</p> <p>VR is a young medium and requires a significant infrastructure push to become adopted to the mainstream. A lack of infrastructure is found on both ends of the value chain of digital media creation: <strong>1.Production</strong> Interactivity in a 360° video can only be achieved if the video is embedded on a website, which creates additional costs for web development. An average video production company with two clients per month will spend an estimate of:</p> <ul> <li><p>5,350€ for PC and 360° camera; </p></li> <li><p>2,600€ per year for software licenses and freelance web developers; </p></li> <li><p>20 hours of work per project.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Consumption</strong></p> <p>The access to interactive content and the device used for consumption is  as important as the content creation itself. The US alone counts 2,2 mio. people in a wheelchair who are significantly limited in participating in socio-cultural events like festivals or football matches. Interactive 360 streaming creates freedom in exploration for people who are bound by physical or regional limitations.</p>
