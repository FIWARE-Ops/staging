Through QUHOMA not only does the end-user/farmer collect sensor data from the field but he can also share them with a community of users that whom these data make business sense to share with. </p> <p>Moreover, QUHOMA invites additional business entities to provide their content (agronomic services, business advices, quality inspection forms and procedures, administrative consultants) and also share these within QUHOMA common MARKET tool where everyone consumes and provides services. It is a win-win solution  for both producers, other established businesses in the agrifood value chain, and the final consumers all wishing to enjoy traceable quality products.</p>
