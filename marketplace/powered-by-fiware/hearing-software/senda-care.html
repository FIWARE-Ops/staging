  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: Hearing Software - Senda Care (Gamification,Internet of Things)</h1>
  <p>
   Senda care is a modular platform, a new service designed with features such as the care of people who need support through their own network of relatives.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Senda Care</strong> is a mobile app. We have developed a modular platform that has the following features:</p> <ul> <li>Care: This section is focused on the personalized care of elderly or disabled people.. Using a collaborative platform, we connect elderly or persons with disabilities with certified caregivers. Our users can look for a caregiver on an hourly-basis, for a weekend, or for weeks, while it gives relatives a chance to take some time off..</li> </ul> <p>Another feature is that families with economical difficulties every month can apply to share the home with the elderly. This is suitable for families who have lost their homes. In fact, this model already exists in some Universities, where young people can share their home with the elderly, in exchange for doing the shopping, making dinner, and taking care of other minor things. We are introducing this model to families at risk of social exclusion, and to match them with other areas of the population that are also isolated and at  risk of social exclusion. This way, itâ€™s a win-win..</p> <ul> <li><p>Geolocalization: The relative or caregiver can track the last 12 hours of a person and check his or her last positions. This works in case of disorientation or if someone is lost. The elderly person just needs a GPS device.</p></li> <li><p>Communication: It is possible to call directly to the GPS device, or to make video calls using a tablet and a phone, with an easy and intuitive app for the elderly with big icons of every relative. Just click to call directly.</p></li> <li><ul> <li>Security: If the person needs help, the GPS device can send an alert to their relatives or caregivers, and automatically perform a voice call with  them. At this moment, the device also updates the position.</li></ul></li> <li><p>Digital Home: The References/Customers can choose a variety of sensors and actuators in order to cover their needs. This gives more security and peace of mind. Some of these sensors are adapted for hearing impaired people (notification of bell doors, fire or gas leak alarms, etc), and also sensors and actuators for other collectives, digital lock, remote door opening, open/close windows, and others.</p></li> </ul> <p>The digital lock is a key advantage in our system, because in case of an emergency (for example, if the elderly falls down and lies unconscious on the ground), if he or she has the GPS device, it will detect the fall, notify the family and relatives, or caregivers, who can then open the door remotely for the emergency services once they arrive at the home. Without digital locks, they would need to wait for police or firefighters to open the door, or wait for someone with the physical keys. This saves a valuable time.</p>
  
  <p>Our stakeholders are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Elderly or Dependent Persons: Those who will receive the care and improve their quality of life.</p></li> <li><p>Relatives: It can be to be more connected to his/her loved ones, or to stay informed of the emergencies. Examples include an SOS alert, opening the digital lock remotely, or just to look for a caregiver for the weekend so they can take some time off.</p></li> <li><p>Caregivers: They are certified people that will charge for the services, for hours, weekend, or weeks, whatever the relatives and caregivers agree on.</p></li> <li><p>Social Caregivers: In case of house sharing with families, we want to add social caregivers from the council in order to defend and guarantee the rights of the elderl</p></li> </ul>
