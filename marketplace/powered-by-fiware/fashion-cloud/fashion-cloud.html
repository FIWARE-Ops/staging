  <p>
   FASHION CLOUD is the leading content exchange platform in the fashion industry.
  </p>
  <p><strong>FASHION CLOUD</strong> is Europe’s leading content exchange platform for the fashion industry. More than 250 brands share marketing material and product data on our platform. We have 2,500 wholesalers from more than 45 countries using our service to get easy access to high-quality image content from their suppliers. </p> <p>Brands such as GANT, Betty Barclay, Marc O’Polo, and Scotch &amp; Soda use FASHION CLOUD to distribute pictures to retailers like Engelhorn, Appelrath, and Kaufhof. All content can be accessed through an online platform (where images are downloaded manually) or via our API.</p> <p>Connecting ERP systems or webshops to our API allows all content to automatically flow into the retailer IT system without any manual effort. With FASHION CLOUD brands unify their brand presence and connect to potential new business partners.  Retailers gain access to valuable content to run their marketing channels. Our database contains millions of product pictures. Our backend handles millions of API calls. Serving as a “content broker” for the fashion industry is basically our main task to be excellent at keeping tons of data.  We decided to rely on FIWARE technology when it comes to analyzing what exactly happens with it.</p>
  <p>Many local fashion retailers are facing hard times competing against pure e-commerce players (Amazon, Zalando etc.) and vertical fashion companies (Zara, H&amp;M etc.). They are especially struggling when it comes to online visibility. For todays’ References/Customers, it is crucial to find stores and products online. It is still not the core competence of brick and mortar stores to run a website or even a webshop. </p> <p>Furthermore, it is very cumbersome for a retailer to collect and create content for digital marketing channels. Product photos, article descriptions and campaign shootings are required for hundreds of fashion brands. But where and how to  find them?</p>
