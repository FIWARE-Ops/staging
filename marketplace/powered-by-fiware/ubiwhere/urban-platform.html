  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: Ubiwhere - Urban Platform (Internet of Things,Open Data,Data Analytics)</h1>
  <p>
   Our Urban Platform allows data collection from multiple domains and provides city managers and decision-makers with a holistic view of their cities, presenting cross-domain data in a unified way.
  </p>
  <p>Our <strong>Urban Platform</strong> allows data collection from multiple domains such as traffic, air quality, and waste collection, displaying it in a unified way. Having information from different fields combined in a single, customizable dashboard, enables municipalities to get the information they need to create informed, data-driven policies. This way, decision-makers can ensure that the decisions they take are well-founded and get empirical reports on their impact.</p> <p>Our end-users can set their customized dashboards, choosing the information from any source available and combining it through different domains such as mobility, environment and public policies, with the ultimate purpose of reducing operational costs, reducing greenhouse gasses emissions, and improving their citizens' overall quality of life.</p>
