  <p>
   Scuter offers a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) solution based on an innovative electric smart ride-on scooter designed just for sharing. Clean, agile, and safe, Scuter reduces vehicle footprints in the city.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Scuter</strong> has developed a vertically integrated service to overcome and satisfy widespread fast and clean urban commuting demand. We designed a 3-wheels electric scooter that can be driven without wearing a helmet. This blinks at car drivers that are not used to motorcycle driving experience and are looking for an alternative to their cars. Our service will be a free-floating pay per use vehicle sharing, with  dynamic pricing based on an AI algorithm that will allow References/Customers to earn money if they help us with logistics and battery swap, thus reducing the opex for us. We are enabling a crypto token service to leverage  the cleantech economy. Our design inputs were:</p> <ul> <li>A fast and light scooter: cars in any form (proprietary or shared) are too traffic affected in urban environments. </li> <li>The safest and the cleanest scooter. </li> <li>Everyone must feel comfortable in using SCUTER, not only the experienced riders.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, Scuter is:</p> <ul> <li>Clean: Zero-emissions, 100% electric vehicle. </li> <li>Easy: You just need your smartphone to pick Scuter up. </li> <li>Safe: 3-wheels, safety belts, no helmet, just ride and save your time. </li> <li>Smart: Use the smart platform onboard to connect to your friends and have fun.</li> </ul>
  <p>Scuter aims to attack the issue of traffic jams in urban commuting, parking problems, and inefficient ways to move</p>
  <p>Car drivers (especially professionals), Students, Commuters and Tourists moving Downtown.</p>
