   Urbo is a Smart Cities operational dashboard that analyzes real-time data coming from sensors on parking, waste management, street lighting, water management, environmental data, city alerts, etc.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Urbo</strong> is a Smart Cities operational dashboard.  It analyzes real-time data coming from sensors on parking, waste management, street lighting, water management, environmental data, city alerts, etc.  It shows in real-time the values that  each sensor emits for the management and monitoring of the results, while enabling the generation of essential KPI reports.  It includes Machine Learning for predictions. The aim of the project is to improve  efficiency, reduce energy costs and environmental impact. Lastly, there are multiple possibilities for prediction and optimization, using a groundbreaking user experience:</p> <ul> <li><p>Relocate or create new facilities and resources for optimizing their indicators, like parking.</p></li> <li><p>Prevent through prediction unwanted events, like traffic jams. </p></li> <li><p>Optimize repetitive tasks, like a waste collection.</p></li> </ul>
  <p>City governments and managers need to monitor and predict in real-time the results of sensors scattered in cities, analyzing information and offering it to managers to facilitate the decision-making process.</p> <p>Set of applications that process data in real-time. The private portal displays all the information, it shows in real-time the values that each sensor emits for the management and monitoring of the results while enabling the generation of essential KPI reports.</p>
