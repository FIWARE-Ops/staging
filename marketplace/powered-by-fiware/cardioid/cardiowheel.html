  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: CardioID - CardioWheel (Internet of Things,Data Analytics)</h1>
  <p>
   Cardio Wheel is an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that can help you prevent drowsiness and automatically detect the identity of the driver.
  </p>
  <p><strong>CardioWheel</strong> is an Advanced Driver Assistance System that acquires the electrocardiogram (ECG) from the driver’s hands to continuously detect drowsiness, cardiac health problems, and biometric identity recognition.</p> <p>The cardiac signal is acquired in real-time from your hands. We do this using a custom steering wheel cover equipped with special conductive elements, thus capturing the electrical impulses generated by your heart. After acquisition, the cardiac signal is processed locally, making use of advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms to extract information related to drowsiness and fatigue. An alert is immediately issued to the driver if fatigue has been detected. For fleets of vehicles, we provide a dashboard aggregating geographically referenced fatigue information. This enables the fleet manager to take action and plan for fatigue-related driver performance.</p> <p>Lastly, CardioWheel can be extended with third-party systems, such as Mobileye and GeoTab, providing complete fleet management solutions for enhanced road safety.</p>
  <p>Safety on the road has always been of utmost concern to authorities and governments around the globe, where countless lives have been taken due to carelessness, negligence, or sheer bad luck. CardioWheel aims to make the roads feel much safer.</p>
  <p>CardioWheel market focus are primarily transportation and logistic companies. The largest passenger transportation company in Portugal - Barraqueiro Transportes is one of the major clients of CardioID, having several buses with CardioID's ADAS solution - CardioWheel + Mobileye + Geotab (only in some situations).</p>
