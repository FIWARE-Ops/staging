  <h1>Powered by FIWARE: Atos - MASAI (Internet of Things,Additive Manufacturing,Data Analytics)</h1>
  <p>
   MASAI is an efficient data integration software for manufacturing systems allowing to collect data from a variety of IoT Devices in the manufacturing domain (Industry 4.0), that is not entirely covered by existing proprietary solutions.
  </p>
  <p><strong>MASAI</strong> is a Data Collector and System Integrator middleware component focused on IoT devices developed based on the experience gained in Manufacturing. MASAI is composed of  a set of components that tackle three different issues: communication, management of the devices and handling of data. </p> <ul> <li>Communication: grating interoperability and adaptation between different protocols and the matching between consumers and providers of data. </li> <li>Device Management functionalities to enclose generic information about devices and also to address their security and connectivity. </li> <li>Data handling functionalities, MASAI is also granted with a subcomponent that ensures that the data obtained in the IoT world is pre-filtered before being passed to a consumer, reducing the flow or the quantity of inaccurate data. Among its main capabilities, it can be highlighted: </li> <li>Based on Generic Enablers from FIWARE and extended to enhance communication capabilities. * Facilitates interoperability among systems. </li> <li>Devices Virtualization, which allows  aggregating of data and the creation of virtual entities. </li> <li>Data filtering, limiting dataflow or access to inaccurate data to higher layers. </li> <li>Provides monitoring of device capacities. </li> <li>Supports well-known IoT protocols: MQTT, OPC UA, AMQP, and socket.io. </li> <li>Allows communication with Cloud platforms like FIWARE and Siemens MindSphere. Visualization capabilities of real-time and historical data to facilitate the follow up of a process.</li> </ul>
  <p>Today's enterprises are linearly organized and optimized within the boundaries of companies and system silos, while companies of the future will fulfill individual customer needs by using a collaborative and agile network of capabilities. In this context, IoT will have an important role in the vertical and horizontal integration of systems.  New IT technologies allow us to retrieve, connect and interpret all the data generated during the manufacturing process. Making use of that data will help companies to have more control over their own processes, supporting them when decision making is needed and so, becoming more effective and competitive</p>
  <p>SMEs and software developers interested in FIWARE based technologies</p>
