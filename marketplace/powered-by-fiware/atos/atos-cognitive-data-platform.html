Atos is also providing the cities and customers with the analysis of the use cases and business scenarios which may provide a better response to their needs and provide an added value and better service to the citizens and users. </p> <p><strong>ACdP</strong> has been developed using the most novel technologies both in the backend and frontend. The solution is  easy integration with any external system via API (ERPs, issue management systems, etc); deployable both in the cloud and on-premise, according to customer’s needs; and replicable and customizable to each customer’s requirements. <strong>ACdP</strong> is relying on consolidated open source technologies in the market which facilitates the adoption and lowers the maintenance costs and prevents the vendor lock-in as the <strong>ACdP</strong> is delivered under open source as well. The support to the open-source components from FIWARE is guaranteed by the FIWARE Foundation and Atos is providing full support to the <strong>ACdP</strong> platform, keeping the evolution of the technology up to date. Thanks to the modularity of the platform architecture, a future extension to adapt it to new scenarios or to add new functionalities would be quite straightforward.
