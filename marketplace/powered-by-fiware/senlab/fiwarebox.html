  <p><a href="https://fiwarebox.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA3Na5BhAZEiwAzrfagMBtVonaxxI_kgyJfScFJgVUS13nVuE-UD7MkbjJdEz7jQ7-pS8exxoCW-4QAvD_BwE" title="**FIWAREBox**"><strong>FIWAREBox</strong></a> is an all-in-one SandBoxOS platform designed to simplify the use of FIWARE, an open-source framework for building smart solutions in areas such as IoT, Smart Cities, Industry, Logistic, HomeAutomatization, AAL, and eHealth. It brings together key components of the FIWARE ecosystem, including pre-configured tools, services, and development environments. This enables developers, businesses, and public institutions to quickly create, deploy, and scale applications. FIWAREBox includes built-in components such as the Orion broker for data management, CKAN for accessing OpenData, Kurento for video, MQTT for IoT communication, and various analytics tools such as Grafana and TensorFlow.</p> <p>Key Benefits:</p> <ul> <li>Streamlined Development: FIWAREBox reduces setup complexity by offering pre-configured solutions, saving time and enabling faster project launches.</li> <li>Scalability: Suitable for both small-scale experiments and large-scale deployments, providing flexibility across different project needs.</li> <li>Flexibility: Cloud, on-premises,  or a hardware EDGE device.</li> <li>Interoperability: Facilitates easy integration with IoT devices, cloud platforms, and data sources, allowing seamless data-driven operations.</li> <li>Collaboration and Compliance: FIWAREBox supports collaboration within the FIWARE community and includes security features to ensure regulatory compliance.</li> </ul> <p>FIWAREBox consists of:</p> <ul> <li>SandBoxOS (the IoT OS) with the software center (not only FIWARE components but also various brokers, like EMQ, Mosquitto, RabbitMQ, Kafka; Grafana, Prometheus, TensorFlow, KeyCloak …), all together more than 60 packages.</li> <li>FIWARE servers, brokers, generic enablers.</li> <li>fully customized dashboards and visualizations.</li> <li>node-RED scripts.</li> <li>documentation.</li> <li>update center.</li> </ul>
  <p>The main challenge that FIWAREBox aims to address is the complexity of setting up and utilizing the FIWARE ecosystem. While FIWARE offers robust tools for IoT and smart city development, many users face difficulties in configuring the architecture, managing updates, and integrating various components. FIWAREBox simplifies this by providing an all-in-one package with essential tools pre-configured, which reduces the time spent on installation and system integration.</p> <p>Another contextual challenge involves the growing need for scalable solutions in IoT and digital transformation projects. As smart city and industrial IoT projects expand, organizations require systems that can scale efficiently and manage increasing amounts of data. FIWAREBox is designed to handle this need by offering a flexible environment that can adapt to different project sizes, from small R&amp;D initiatives to full-scale deployments​.</p>
  <p>FIWAREBox is used in a <a href="https://www.pharaon.eu/" title="PHArA-ON">PHArA-ON</a> EU-funded project (pharaon.eu), other SandBoxOS flavours in industry, automation and child monitoring  (kids watch) IoT projects.</p>
  <p><a href="https://iotool.io/" title="IoTool">IoTool</a> platform is a part of FIWAREBox and holds multiple prominent awards, like from Mobile World Congress in Barcelona as the best IoT platform.</p>
